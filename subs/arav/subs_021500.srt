4050
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:06,079
## has never done yeah no i know that's




4051
02:15:06,079 --> 02:15:07,679
## yeah i think we're on the same page with




4052
02:15:07,679 --> 02:15:09,040
## that that's why i just i think we can




4053
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:10,560
## just kind of go on because i don't




4054
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:12,400
## i don't like that i see others doing it




4055
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,000
## i'm like okay cool but




4056
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,679
## it doesn't sit right for me to promote




4057
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:17,520
## these massive monster companies




4058
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,639
## uh it doesn't feel right um but but if




4059
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:22,239
## people do it that's their call right




4060
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,000
## it's not for me my point i was going to




4061
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,679
## make though with this is that




4062
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:27,599
## so for example quorn is a massive




4063
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:28,880
## company in the uk i don't know if




4064
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:29,360
## they're in




4065
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:31,040
## australia too but they uh they're one of




4066
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:32,800
## the oh cool so like the og




4067
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:35,520
## like um fake meat mock meat companies




4068
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,239
## and




4069
02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:37,360
## they they have this thing called




4070
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:39,040
## microprotein and that was tested on




4071
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:40,719
## animals when they first released it




4072
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:43,040
## but the pushback was so intense and from




4073
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:44,159
## vegetarians




4074
02:15:44,159 --> 02:15:47,440
## that they had to like reconvene




4075
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:48,880
## and they released a statement where




4076
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:50,880
## basically the uh i think it was the ceo




4077
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,239
## i can't remember it's on their website




4078
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:53,040
## right now




4079
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:56,719
## um he basically says that he he regrets




4080
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:57,119
## it




4081
02:15:57,119 --> 02:15:58,320
## that he wishes that he did it




4082
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:00,159
## differently or she i can't remember if




4083
02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:01,199
## it's a guy or a girl




4084
02:16:01,199 --> 02:16:02,719
## and they said they will never test on




4085
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:04,239
## animals ever again this company will




4086
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:05,520
## never do it ever again




4087
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:07,199
## and uh we totally listen to your




4088
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:08,719
## feedback and it's done




4089
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:11,679
## um versus unfortunately the impossible




4090
02:16:11,679 --> 02:16:12,400
## burger




4091
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,079
## impossible foods and i think beyond




4092
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:15,840
## foods as well i think beyond me also




4093
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:17,760
## say this they're saying the opposite




4094
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:18,639
## like they're saying they're going to




4095
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:20,159
## continue to test




4096
02:16:20,159 --> 02:16:21,840
## for me and for many i think that's where




4097
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,360
## they draw the line and say wait a minute




4098
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,360
## okay testing once is one thing




4099
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:27,360
## testing once and saying yeah we see




4100
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,639
## you're pissed off and we know it's wrong




4101
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:29,920
## but we're going to do it again if we




4102
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:32,080
## if we want to they they draw a




4103
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:33,760
## distinction between these two companies




4104
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,359
## and one being like okay we'll support




4105
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:35,920
## this one




4106
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:37,040
## and the other one they say no we're not




4107
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:37,920
## going to support them because they're




4108
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,439
## pro with a section




4109
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:41,359
## you know where do you stand on on that




4110
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:44,080
## comparison that logic doesn't work




4111
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:47,519
## that logic does not work because corn is




4112
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:49,280
## still selling products with cheese and




4113
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:50,160
## egg in it




4114
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,879
## um or at least egg yeah they have a




4115
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:54,959
## vegetarian range and a vegan brain




4116
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:56,799
## so yeah okay they're against animal




4117
02:16:56,799 --> 02:16:58,398
## testing they're still not a vegan




4118
02:16:58,398 --> 02:16:59,599
## company however




4119
02:16:59,599 --> 02:17:01,760
## yeah in exactly the same way that




4120
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:04,240
## impossible foods is not a vegan company




4121
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:07,920
## so sure bad comparison then yeah




4122
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:11,359
## yeah well no it's just people are




4123
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:12,879
## getting angry about what they choose to




4124
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:15,040
## be angry about




4125
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,439
## yeah i think it's about being consistent




4126
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:19,040
## that's a great point because they're not




4127
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,879
## a vegan company and the whole range is




4128
02:17:20,879 --> 02:17:21,920
## not vegan so




4129
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,558
## why are we only taking issue with animal




4130
02:17:24,558 --> 02:17:25,920
## testing and not what




4131
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:27,519
## happens to the animals in the dairy egg




4132
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:29,200
## industry




4133
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:31,120
## sure sure it's about that's my bad




4134
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:32,718
## that's a bad comparison with corn




4135
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:34,240
## um i guess what i was trying to get at




4136
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:36,080
## is is uh we've




4137
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:37,599
## supported a company that is going to say




4138
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:38,718
## that they're going to continue to test




4139
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:39,599
## on animals but




4140
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:42,799
## is producing um plant-based burgers




4141
02:17:42,799 --> 02:17:45,519
## like is is there no is is there no




4142
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:47,040
## ethical consideration to be hard here i




4143
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:49,519
## guess is what i'm trying to say




4144
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:52,000
## of course come on man of course there it




4145
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:52,959
## is




4146
02:17:52,959 --> 02:17:55,679
## of course of course we need to ask




4147
02:17:55,679 --> 02:17:57,040
## impossible foods




4148
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,679
## to cut the [ __ ] and stop testing on




4149
02:17:59,679 --> 02:18:01,599
## animals and to be vegan




4150
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:04,638
## but the point here is that expecting




4151
02:18:04,638 --> 02:18:05,679
## them to be




4152
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:08,160
## vegan before you buy their product which




4153
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:10,718
## is vegan stand alone




4154
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:14,240
## in and of itself is just a ridiculous




4155
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:17,599
## uh standard to apply if you're going to




4156
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:19,280
## do it you have to be consistent and that




4157
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:20,799
## would make it impractical to be




4158
02:18:20,799 --> 02:18:22,959
## impractical to be vegan it would make it




4159
02:18:22,959 --> 02:18:24,879
## impossible to be vegan




4160
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:28,080
## and i don't mean to use that pun




4161
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:31,359
## but we're in an impossible situation




4162
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:35,120
## sure okay okay um




4163
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:36,318
## yeah i think that's all i wanted to ask




4164
02:18:36,318 --> 02:18:37,120
## about that i don't think there's




4165
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:38,558
## anything else i can go through




4166
02:18:38,558 --> 02:18:40,240
## do you have anything to close on that




4167
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:41,679
## with it being mainly




4168
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:43,120
## the questions targeted at you is there




4169
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:44,240
## anything else you'd like to say to




4170
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:45,200
## people who are still




4171
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:47,840
## like dubious about this or unsure about




4172
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:48,638
## this




4173
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:50,558
## i think that's it just the last point




4174
02:18:50,558 --> 02:18:52,240
## that you said about




4175
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:54,240
## um you know how they've they've




4176
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:56,799
## basically said they will test




4177
02:18:56,799 --> 02:19:00,318
## in the future and then coin saying




4178
02:19:00,318 --> 02:19:02,240
## they will never do it again i just think




4179
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:04,558
## i personally on a personal level




4180
02:19:04,558 --> 02:19:08,080
## i don't take that seriously anyway just




4181
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:09,679
## because the ceo came out and said




4182
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:10,240
## something




4183
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:12,160
## i don't take it either way i don't take




4184
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:13,359
## it as




4185
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:15,519
## seriously as others actually forget




4186
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:17,599
## because i just think okay i'll just wait




4187
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:18,638
## and see




4188
02:19:18,638 --> 02:19:21,200
## in future if impossible keeps doing it




4189
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:22,000
## then




4190
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,359
## i will not be supporting it anymore or




4191
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:27,760
## um at the same time i don't trust that




4192
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:29,760
## company that says we will never do it




4193
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:30,240
## again




4194
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:31,840
## i just don't trust people like that




4195
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:33,280
## because they might do it and




4196
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:35,040
## at the same time they are abusing other




4197
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,879
## animals anyway so that's why




4198
02:19:36,879 --> 02:19:39,280
## like somebody just making a statement on




4199
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,280
## their website is not




4200
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,120
## i don't take it that's here no one no




4201
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:44,558
## one is protesting




4202
02:19:44,558 --> 02:19:47,439
## magnums the vegan magnums the company




4203
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:50,000
## whether they put out a statement or not




4204
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,040
## uh are saying in their actions that




4205
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:55,920
## they do not reject animal abuse that




4206
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:57,600
## they will continue to condone it




4207
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:59,840
## and sell products and make money off the




4208
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:00,960
## backs of animals
