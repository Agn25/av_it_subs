1202
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,599
## saying they won't they won't go to av



1203
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,040
## events because of this um so yeah



1204
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,920
## this is the topic we're going to get



1205
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,839
## into i'll ask you a question someone



1206
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,440
## just asked this question earlier



1207
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,280
## uh why do intersectionals



1208
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
## intersectionals not like you



1209
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,560
## that's what someone said so that's an



1210
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,079
## easy question to start with why do these



1211
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,440
## people hate you why are they coming for



1212
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,839
## you



1213
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,119
## why are they trying to cancel you why



1214
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,960
## are they trying to ruin um your



1215
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,839
## organization



1216
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,000
## you want to go only um



1217
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,880
## yeah i i guess yeah like you you already



1218
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,079
## explained that



1219
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,359
## it's not that we're anti-intersectional



1220
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,480
## um we just made a decision that



1221
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,440
## av is going to be 100 dedicated to the



1222
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,359
## animals non-human animals



1223
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,560
## and there are many reasons why we



1224
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,720
## decided on that



1225
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,599
## but that doesn't mean that we don't



1226
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,839
## think or anyone within the organization



1227
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,319
## not just



1228
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,680
## us too doesn't believe that other groups



1229
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,920
## of beings need



1230
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,640
## um voices to speak up for them or we



1231
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,240
## shouldn't be doing activism in different



1232
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,480
## areas so it's again it's just the way



1233
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,839
## that people



1234
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,800
## decide to interpret this like someone



1235
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,160
## decided that because



1236
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,680
## av is 100 dedicated to non-human animals



1237
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,119
## that means that



1238
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,400
## we have hatred towards humans or



1239
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,880
## we there's discrimination when it comes



1240
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
## to certain groups of humans



1241
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
## and they're just running with that idea



1242
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,359
## i think it's



1243
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,520
## easy to paint that image of us



1244
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,440
## given that we are aware of the fact



1245
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,680
## that we dedicate av 100 to animal rights



1246
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,359
## in light of a temp



1247
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,480
## the temperament currently in society is



1248
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:50,800
## that



1249
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,040
## anyone who does such a thing must also



1250
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,400
## pander



1251
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,560
## to human rights otherwise it's totally



1252
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,079
## out of place so we're completely aware



1253
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,839
## of this



1254
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,280
## and we still won't pander so



1255
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,440
## it's easy to paint us like that but we



1256
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,560
## don't care because



1257
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,760
## we want for this to exist in the world



1258
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,200
## we want a movement who is still willing



1259
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,319
## to just



1260
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,480
## do the right thing in the face of what



1261
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,760
## is popular in



1262
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,680
## the moment and you've been also



1263
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,400
## a popular thing that comes up when



1264
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
## discussing these things is the the idea



1265
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,480
## of a hierarchy of oppression



1266
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,960
## of which it it appears that you that you



1267
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,520
## guys



1268
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,240
## do um have a hierarchy as in you i've



1269
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,200
## heard at least



1270
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
## you paul especially i've heard this but



1271
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,880
## i don't know if i'm sure you've said it



1272
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,280
## as well



1273
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,119
## and this is not an attack it's just you



1274
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,319
## know just quoting



1275
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,560
## um that the animals are by far the most



1276
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,520
## oppressed beings



1277
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,079
## on the planet right and some people get



1278
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,440
## upset about that because they say that



1279
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,720
## you're creating a hierarchy of



1280
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,240
## oppression and apparently this



1281
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,359
## is this is uh this is wrong um how do



1282
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,599
## you respond to that



1283
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,839
## um that's disrespectful and it's a spit



1284
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,839
## in the face of every animal that



1285
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,200
## that is subjected to that injustice



1286
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,800
## you know you can you can act like



1287
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,359
## you're offended by these semantics all



1288
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,720
## you want



1289
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
## but just remember that while your



1290
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,319
## charade is going on



1291
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,760
## you're spitting in the face of the



1292
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,079
## victims who are involved in the



1293
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,440
## injustice that you're carrying on about



1294
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,400
## and that's my response to that it's just



1295
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,480
## simple that



1296
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,240
## we shouldn't have to explain that we're



1297
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,400
## not saying that humans aren't oppressed



1298
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,560
## what you said doesn't sound like



1299
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,200
## something



1300
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,680
## that resonates with me the hierarchy of



1301
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,440
## oppression



1302
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,359
## but it is a fact that the animals



1303
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,079
## well okay so in terms of the number of



1304
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,839
## individual animals



1305
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,800
## who have been tortured and abused and



1306
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,760
## murdered



1307
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,680
## compared to any other injustice that's



1308
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,160
## literally what we're talking about so



1309
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,400
## i don't think it's i don't think it



1310
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,720
## means like if anyone takes that as



1311
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,119
## so you're saying there is a hierarchy of



1312
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,119
## oppression meaning



1313
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,280
## this group is more oppressed or we



1314
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
## should speak up for them first that's



1315
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,160
## not what we're saying you can't take



1316
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,880
## that from



1317
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,200
## from saying you know animals are the



1318
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,160
## most suppressed meaning they have been



1319
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,119
## um they have been oppressed for the



1320
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,560
## longest



1321
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
## and the number of individual victims is



1322
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,640
## higher than any other injustice that's



1323
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,480
## just the fact that's the reality of it



1324
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,280
## and



1325
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,200
## you're right if somebody gets upset



1326
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,640
## because of that



1327
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,560
## then i think they need to just reflect



1328
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,560
## on why that is because



1329
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,720
## i know that there are people out there



1330
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,560
## that were more oppressed than me



1331
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,319
## as as a woman of color



1332
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,640
## and so therefore anyone else in any
