5296
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:02,479
## just i guess what i'm trying to say is



5297
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:04,240
## like assume



5298
02:55:04,240 --> 02:55:06,240
## good intentions stop assuming bad



5299
02:55:06,240 --> 02:55:07,680
## intentions of people



5300
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:09,840
## um whoever you're talking to really like



5301
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:11,439
## give them a chance to prove themselves



5302
02:55:11,439 --> 02:55:12,240
## to be



5303
02:55:12,240 --> 02:55:14,960
## you know good don't don't look for bad



5304
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:16,800
## look for good and assume they want



5305
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:18,560
## the best i think is it's really



5306
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:20,399
## important we'll have one more question



5307
02:55:20,399 --> 02:55:22,160
## and then we'll close off it's it's a



5308
02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:25,600
## it's a nice question i think um do the



5309
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:27,760
## where's the money go people have any



5310
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:28,960
## idea how much



5311
02:55:28,960 --> 02:55:31,120
## unpaid work that you guys have put into



5312
02:55:31,120 --> 02:55:32,080
## animal rights



5313
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:35,120
## do you think thank you generally



5314
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:38,399
## that's a refreshing perspective



5315
02:55:38,399 --> 02:55:41,520
## to hear and not just for our case



5316
02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:44,560
## and uh it's not just refreshing for



5317
02:55:44,560 --> 02:55:47,680
## for us to hear for you know when i think



5318
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:49,439
## about us and that and the criticisms



5319
02:55:49,439 --> 02:55:50,399
## that we get



5320
02:55:50,399 --> 02:55:52,319
## it's also refreshing to hear that any



5321
02:55:52,319 --> 02:55:53,680
## other



5322
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:55,920
## activist on behalf of any other activist



5323
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:59,439
## that gets similar criticisms like this



5324
02:55:59,439 --> 02:56:00,560
## you know i don't think that animal



5325
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:03,040
## rights activists



5326
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:06,720
## are um getting



5327
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:10,479
## the opportunity given to them all the



5328
02:56:10,479 --> 02:56:12,960
## respects given to them that they deserve



5329
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:17,520
## in terms of acquiring financial security



5330
02:56:17,520 --> 02:56:18,720
## whilst



5331
02:56:18,720 --> 02:56:20,399
## being an animal rights activist



5332
02:56:20,399 --> 02:56:23,040
## full-time



5333
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:27,200
## if there's any question about motives



5334
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:31,359
## then you just have to look at



5335
02:56:31,359 --> 02:56:33,520
## you know like this person has graciously



5336
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:34,800
## pointed out and i think i think it's



5337
02:56:34,800 --> 02:56:36,080
## refreshing because it's



5338
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:38,560
## it's the kind of perspective that really



5339
02:56:38,560 --> 02:56:39,520
## people should have



5340
02:56:39,520 --> 02:56:42,160
## is looking more deeply at the work that



5341
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:42,960
## people do



5342
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:45,760
## and that doesn't lie and if it is a



5343
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:47,439
## question about motives



5344
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:49,520
## then yeah look at all the work we've



5345
02:56:49,520 --> 02:56:51,439
## done when we had no money towards any of



5346
02:56:51,439 --> 02:56:52,960
## this and we put all of our own personal



5347
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:54,080
## money towards everything



5348
02:56:54,080 --> 02:56:58,399
## it's when we went broke



5349
02:56:58,399 --> 02:57:00,160
## putting all of our money into a b from



5350
02:57:00,160 --> 02:57:01,920
## the beginning and we will continue to do



5351
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:03,359
## that



5352
02:57:03,359 --> 02:57:06,560
## to the very end for the for the simple



5353
02:57:06,560 --> 02:57:07,120
## fact



5354
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:09,279
## that it's about the mission it's about



5355
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:10,240
## what



5356
02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:14,560
## the organization is intended for and uh



5357
02:57:14,560 --> 02:57:16,960
## well you know that's the thing i yeah i



5358
02:57:16,960 --> 02:57:17,600
## don't know



5359
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:19,600
## what else to say about this i guess you



5360
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:21,279
## want to answer that



5361
02:57:21,279 --> 02:57:24,080
## yes i just want animal rights activists



5362
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:24,960
## to feel



5363
02:57:24,960 --> 02:57:27,200
## that it's a very viable option for them



5364
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:28,560
## to come into animal rights as an



5365
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:30,800
## activist to be an activist full-time



5366
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:34,000
## part-time and to have financial security



5367
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,560
## and not to



5368
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:40,240
## expect that they're going to



5369
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:45,279
## be walking on on hot coal



5370
02:57:45,279 --> 02:57:48,800
## just because they they do want financial



5371
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:50,160
## security while being



5372
02:57:50,160 --> 02:57:52,000
## by you know while being an animal rights



5373
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,240
## activists i know that we



5374
02:57:54,240 --> 02:57:57,040
## probably entertain on this stream and



5375
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:58,000
## probably entertain



5376
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,640
## the accusations maybe too much i don't



5377
02:58:00,640 --> 02:58:01,439
## know i'll walk



5378
02:58:01,439 --> 02:58:05,760
## back and i'll judge later but uh



5379
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:06,960
## that's why i think it's important to



5380
02:58:06,960 --> 02:58:08,960
## just know that you know



5381
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:11,520
## we need to hold a certain priesthood and



5382
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:13,359
## set a certain tone for animal rights



5383
02:58:13,359 --> 02:58:14,080
## activists



5384
02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:16,399
## in this movement who may be wanting to



5385
02:58:16,399 --> 02:58:18,080
## come into this movie maybe they want to



5386
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:19,680
## come into this movement and become an



5387
02:58:19,680 --> 02:58:20,240
## activist



5388
02:58:20,240 --> 02:58:22,000
## or maybe they're maybe you're already an



5389
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,600
## activist and



5390
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:26,319
## you know i want them to understand that



5391
02:58:26,319 --> 02:58:27,840
## there's nothing wrong



5392
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:30,080
## with fighting for the animals whilst



5393
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:31,760
## also acquiring financial security as



5394
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:34,479
## long as your motive is not financial



5395
02:58:34,479 --> 02:58:38,240
## to begin with yeah



5396
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:40,800
## absolutely and we'll wrap it up there



5397
02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:42,960
## i'll just say that um



5398
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:44,560
## i hope that you said we gave too much



5399
02:58:44,560 --> 02:58:46,160
## attention to some of these topics and i



5400
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:49,439
## would be you know likely to agree but um



5401
02:58:49,439 --> 02:58:51,840
## tended to agree but i think what i was



5402
02:58:51,840 --> 02:58:53,279
## trying to achieve here is to have this



5403
02:58:53,279 --> 02:58:53,760
## be



5404
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:55,040
## in my opinion like the last the last



5405
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:56,560
## time i'm gonna talk about any of this



5406
02:58:56,560 --> 02:58:58,319
## anyway and i hope the last time you also



5407
02:58:58,319 --> 02:58:59,120
## talk about it



5408
02:58:59,120 --> 02:59:00,160
## because this is going to go up on my



5409
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:01,920
## channel now and it's going to have



5410
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:02,560
## sectors



5411
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:04,640
## marked for every single topic so that



5412
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:06,160
## any time anything does come up about



5413
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:06,720
## this



5414
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,640
## and and you know someone's saying asking



5415
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:10,080
## you hey what do i say to this



5416
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:11,680
## you can literally say to them go and



5417
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:13,359
## find you know the topic that they're



5418
02:59:13,359 --> 02:59:14,000
## talking about



5419
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:15,600
## copy paste and if they don't want to



5420
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:18,000
## watch the video well [ __ ] them then



5421
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:19,200
## you know like they they want to keep



5422
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:20,479
## making their quesations fine but if they



5423
02:59:20,479 --> 02:59:21,439
## want to know the truth well we've



5424
02:59:21,439 --> 02:59:22,640
## answered it it's right here



5425
02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:24,160
## that was the goal for this so you're



5426
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:25,600
## right we did give it too much attention



5427
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:27,439
## but that's because this was the goal



5428
02:59:27,439 --> 02:59:29,760
## i don't think most of these accusations



5429
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:30,960
## deserved even



5430
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:34,399
## five seconds of time but i i do



5431
02:59:34,399 --> 02:59:36,240
## i do i do think it's important to have



5432
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:38,479
## it somewhere so that it's dealt with



5433
02:59:38,479 --> 02:59:40,000
## for good you know in my opinion and



5434
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:41,200
## that's kind of what i wanted to achieve



5435
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:43,040
## today and i hope we've achieved that



5436
02:59:43,040 --> 02:59:45,279
## um thank you both for coming here and



5437
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:46,800
## doing this you didn't have to do it and



5438
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:48,720
## i think people overlook that as well you



5439
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:50,319
## you you don't owe anyone anything



5440
02:59:50,319 --> 02:59:51,680
## and you did not have to sit here and



5441
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:53,279
## answer these questions and they weren't



5442
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:54,640
## nice questions they were shitty



5443
02:59:54,640 --> 02:59:55,359
## questions



5444
02:59:55,359 --> 02:59:57,200
## um i know what it feels like to be

02:59:57,200 --> 02:59:58,640
## attacked i know what it feels like to be



5446
02:59:58,640 --> 02:59:59,520
## called these things



5447
