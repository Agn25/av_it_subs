290
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,640
## it's uh it's



291
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
## a bandwagon for us to disagree with you



292
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,640
## on using that comparison but



293
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,680
## but it's uh



294
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,320
## that's just a taste in music which i



295
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,120
## guess is



296
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
## i guess it's a taste in activism



297
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
## i guess you could that's the comparison



298
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
## you're making



299
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
## kind of yeah kind of but i think with



300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
## nickelback



301
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,399
## um well anyway i don't want to get into



302
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,880
## the comparison



303
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
## maybe it's for the best yeah um but i'm



304
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,200
## gonna give an example actually because i



305
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,959
## did have a plan set up for this stream



306
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,320
## but you know what i feel like this is



307
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,360
## relevant right now



308
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
## so i want to tell the viewers a quick



309
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
## story here about something that happened



310
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,600
## um



311
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
## i put these messages out didn't i put



312
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,040
## these posts out on my instagram asking



313
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,000
## people give me some



314
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,120
## give me some questions give me some



315
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
## topics i put it on facebook and by the



316
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
## way one of those posts has blown up with



317
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,360
## a load of



318
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
## nonsense but anyway that's another topic



319
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
## but some people responded to me saying



320
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,279
## you know certain things and i want to



321
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,800
## just bring up one of these responses



322
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
## that i had



323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
## um from somebody on my instagram who



324
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,000
## who had a story to tell and i want to



325
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
## just kind of link it in with what we



326
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
## just said about it's cool to hate av



327
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,519
## it's cool to kind of just you know find



328
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,959
## something wrong and just



329
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,480
## almost even sometimes uh [ __ ] as



330
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,839
## well so i'm going to show you something



331
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:26,480

## and this is real by the way i'm not this



333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,399
## is not designed this wasn't planned this



334
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,680
## is something that genuinely happened and



335
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
## i've got the evidence because i can show



336
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,480

## instagram and you'll see why this is



340
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
## relevant in a moment so

## added like a



349
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,800
## like uh this kind of screen i'm trying



350
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,880
## to get the uh preview screen up

## that uh i put my story out that night



355
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,000
## saying like tell me any topics you think



356
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,440
## should be discussed somebody responded



357
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
## saying this



358
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
## why do you treat your organizers like



359
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,639
## disposable garbage right



360
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,480
## now like on the surface you're thinking



361
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
## wow okay that's



362
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,839
## that's pretty intense right what's going



363
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,920
## on here so i responded to this person



364
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,200
## how do i have to switch this every time



365
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
## yeah i do so i responded to this person



366
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,240
## very simply saying



367
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,839
## basically i responded saying okay give



368
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,200
## us give me some information i need to



369
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,639
## ask this question properly so this is



370
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,680
## the response i got



371
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
## when the allegations of fraud came up i



372
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,560
## commented on one of paul's comments



373
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,000
## stating something along the lines of it



374
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
## being standard practice to ask for



375
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,399
## financial information



376
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,600
## paul was very aggressive in his



377
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
## responses even abusive i told him i was



378
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,120
## one of the organizers and he told me to



379
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,959
## [ __ ] off and leave so i stood down



380
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,320
## these are not isolated incidents



381
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,920
## unfortunately his temper gets in the way



382
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,120
## and he burns his people



383
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
## his own people good luck so



384
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,399
## i i'm not saying that i don't believe



385
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,160
## that person and at the time i said you



386
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
## know okay i believe you



387
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
## but i need some evidence right i need



388
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,160
## something to show here do you have a



389
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,839
## screenshot do you have something to show



390
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,320
## me



391
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,680
## that i can show to them and uh you know



392
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,079
## i'm happy to discuss it and this is the



393
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,079
## answer that i got



394
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,680
## i don't he cleans up his message



395
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,279
## straight away i know you believe me but



396
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,000
## understand



397
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
## you need for proof you could perhaps



398
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
## pose the question more broadly is this



399
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
## is behavior as a pattern of his



400
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
## and so will be hard to deny sorry i



401
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,959
## can't help you any further david so



402
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
## it's pretty damning right this is pretty



403
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,639
## damning and at the time i gotta admit



404
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,399
## that i was a little bit like



405
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,199
## swayed because look i know paul and i



406
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,720
## know you both paul and the style and i



407
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,399
## know that sometimes you know



408
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,399
## i lose my [ __ ] too i say things that i



409
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
## later come to regret i told people to



410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,519
## [ __ ] off i've told i told someone to



411
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,800
## [ __ ] off live



412
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
## in a live stream by by accident i



413
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,000
## thought they were saying something that



414
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,519
## they weren't i told them to [ __ ] off and



415
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,560
## then they were like why



416
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,800
## what's wrong i only said this i got



417
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
## completely mixed up so it's not it's not



418
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,199
## like you know



419
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,600
## we're infallible we make mistakes but



420
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,199
## anyway i brought this up with you guys



421
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,399
## right



422
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,760
## and um luckily paul actually had the



423
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,360
## screenshots of this interaction



424
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,399
## now i'm going to show you what the



425
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,399
## actual interaction was



426
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
## actually hold up i just realized there's



427
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,440
## one little thing i need to blur out



428
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,639
## but you're not going to believe you're



429
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,760
## not going to believe what the actual



430
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,079
## interaction went like um



431
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
## on the surface of this it looks it



432
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,199
## obviously looks like it's a done deal



433
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:33,839
## right



434
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,120
## and i'm going to explain why this is



435
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
## relevant after i've shown you if you're



436
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,000
## wondering



437
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
## watching this if you're wondering what



438
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,639
## how is this relevant you'll see in a



439
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,600
## moment



440
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,160
## and i'd just like to add that this is



441
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,760
## how people commonly talk



442
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
## about they be when they say negative



443
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
## things about us



444
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,680
## yeah definitely definitely this is this



445
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,199
## is this is why i'm bringing it up it's



446
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:53,680
## it is



447
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,920
## absolutely like this and i want to get



448
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
## into this as a topic as well it's not



449
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,560
## just



450
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,079
## a thing but hey look so here we go this
