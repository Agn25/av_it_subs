## can receive two thousand dollars or




911
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,480
## something




912
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,279
## it was there were certain criterias that




913
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:07,679
## you




914
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,320
## you need to meet as an organizer or as a




915
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,039
## chapter




916
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,039
## you need to be active you need to be




917
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,320
## doing a minimum number of




918
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,200
## cubes and you need to be you know




919
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,360
## operating for a certain amount of time




920
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,240
## and then even with that because the




921
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,440
## money was limited




922
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,480
## we had to pick chapters so




923
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,240
## sometimes it was just you know picking




924
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,840
## this chapter over the other chapter and




925
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,240
## then




926
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,919
## next month they would have a higher




927
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,520
## chance of getting it but




928
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,000
## um yeah there will be many organizers




929
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
## that would actually




930
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
## be able to come forward and say yeah we




931
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,480
## received that and this is what we spent




932
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,080
## it on but i mean




933
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
## our conditions for our criteria for




934
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,000
## being




935
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,039
## accepted in in getting the funding




936
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,679
## was nothing crazy like you had to be on




937
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,279
## board for six months




938
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,399
## you know just six months and do one




939
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,320
## a month i think that's what yeah one




940
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,399
## cube a month so you had to do a




941
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,600
## total amount of six cubes before we




942
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,000
## would




943
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,760
## we would look at giving you money yeah




944
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,559
## and yeah you know that's nothing that's




945
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,519
## nothing too




946
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,559
## strenuous i think what's happened is




947
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,440
## a lot of organizers don't really pay




948
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,000
## attention




949
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,120
## to what we do they they come on and




950
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,320
## they just do their own thing in their




951
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,159
## own cities and they




952
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,919
## want to be a king or a queen in their




953
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,159
## own on their own mountains




954
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,519
## and and literally we've seen so many




955
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,000
## people come




956
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
## and go who carry this attitude with the




957
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,440
## navy




958
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,039
## they just do their own thing in their




959
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,039
## own city and




960
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,080
## they aren't a part of what we're doing




961
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,720
## as a global movement and uh




962
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,399
## and these people don't really pay




963
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,000
## attention to the things that we have




964
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,559
## going on




965
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,039
## yeah and they don't really know about




966
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:53,679
## these




967
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,960
## uh things 20




968
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,039
## 20 details so they don't apply and then




969
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,320
## they complain that they never got the




970
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,159
## money




971
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,440
## right um




972
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,480
## how do you how do you think we can




973
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,720
## handle that i mean this is uh not even




974
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,200
## an av




975
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
## specific thing but we can we can talk




976
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
## about it for a second that




977
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,240
## it's something i've also experienced not




978
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,600
## only in av but in




979
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,279
## save and also in in even you know




980
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,440
## grassroots like non like local




981
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,799
## grassroots organizations local




982
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,640
## grassroots groups is that there seems to




983
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,000
## always be some kind of power




984
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
## struggle going on in these groups i




985
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,279
## don't know if it's only within




986
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,039
## animal rights or if it's also within i




987
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,399
## don't know women's rights if it's in




988
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,000
## black lives matter i don't know if it's




989
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,039
## in all these groups i




990
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,960
## have not been in those groups for enough




991
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,720
## time to know but in animal rights it




992
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,880
## seems to be that in every single group




993
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
## there is a power struggle of somebody




994
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,080
## trying to take over and somebody else




995
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,600
## who's trying to take over that person




996
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,159
## and




997
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,840
## you know somebody who's trying to reject




998
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
## the leader they have or whatever you




999
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,600
## want to call them leader whatever it is




1000
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,679
## it's it's it seems to be very common




1001
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,880
## like what do you think




1002
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,200
## what's causing that and uh would you




1003
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,360
## have a suggestion on on how to




1004
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,159
## how to fix that




1005
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,760
## well you know one of the things i'm




1006
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,840
## really proud of with av




1007
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,039
## is that we really took into account like




1008
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,799
## how we're taken by the public and




1009
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,080
## the fact that we want to be taken




1010
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,000
## seriously and like we want to address




1011
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,399
## that




1012
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,960
## within the public eye and




1013
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,720
## we don't necessarily expect people to




1014
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,440
## trust




1015
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,720
## our leadership to like trust our




1016
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,960
## decision making




1017
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,679
## but i think it's safe to say we've




1018
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,960
## earned




1019
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,919
## a certain level of trust because you




1020
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,320
## know we stick to our ship pretty well




1021
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,799
## and we do what we do pretty well and




1022
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,519
## and uh those who choose to trust our




1023
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,480
## leadership




1024
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,960
## aren't forced to choose that they choose




1025
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,279
## it on their own accord




1026
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,399
## and i guess if you want that entitlement




1027
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:58,799
## that




1028
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,840
## asylum and i have earned




1029
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,840
## to run an organization the way that we




1030
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,440
## choose




1031
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,719
## then you should start your own




1032
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,119
## organization




1033
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,918
## sure if you come on to some come on




1034
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,199
## board with someone else




1035
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,359
## you know you choose to volunteer or you




1036
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,879
## choose to




1037
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,480
## work for an organization and you're on




1038
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,119
## boarding their ethos




1039
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,199
## and representing what their movement is




1040
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,320
## about




1041
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,520
## you really have no right to say




1042
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,879
## you shouldn't make the decisions




1043
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,960
## sure sure so the idea is kind of




1044
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,320
## do you think the baby should be some




1045
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,399
## kind of i don't know




1046
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
## um let's say a self-reflection with




1047
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,560
## people who




1048
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,639
## who join groups or who start to work




1049
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,639
## with not just av but with any group




1050
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,280
## really




1051
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,119
## that if you are going to volunteer with




1052
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,960
## a group um




1053
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,800
## i guess you need to learn that maybe
