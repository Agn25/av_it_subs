4209
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:02,399
## because just look at the rest of their



4210
02:20:02,399 --> 02:20:04,160
## range same could be said



4211
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:06,640
## about cliff bars same could be said



4212
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:07,200
## about



4213
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,439
## literally every other product that we as



4214
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:12,399
## vegans consume



4215
02:20:12,399 --> 02:20:15,359
## and these companies that they come from



4216
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:17,120
## are not vegan companies



4217
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:20,560
## so it's just asinine to expect this uh



4218
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:23,280
## from impossible like just because you



4219
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:24,319
## eat their burger



4220
02:20:24,319 --> 02:20:25,840
## it doesn't mean you condone them as a



4221
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,840
## company if that's the case you're



4222
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:30,960
## condoning every company you ever



4223
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:33,600
## purchase anything from but you're really



4224
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:35,280
## just condoning that product



4225
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:38,800
## you're really just buying a product yeah



4226
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,080
## and then to people that take that



4227
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,359
## position and some people do take that



4228
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:42,640
## position that by buying the product



4229
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:43,200
## you're



4230
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:46,560
## in the company um and um and it's like



4231
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:47,760
## you said i think it's



4232
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:51,120
## practically impossible uh to do that but



4233
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:53,120
## then they would argue that okay but



4234
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,200
## it's not it's practically impossible but



4235
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:56,960
## then surely that that's that's the same



4236
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:58,399
## as saying it's practically impossible to



4237
02:20:58,399 --> 02:20:59,359
## be vegan



4238
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:00,800
## but we're just doing the best we can and



4239
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,479
## we're going to make extra efforts to not



4240
02:21:02,479 --> 02:21:03,760
## buy from companies that we know



4241
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:05,680
## are are really bad though what do you



4242
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,280
## think that would be



4243
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:08,800
## an incorrect statement because that



4244
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:10,479
## would suggest a different definition of



4245
02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:11,439
## veganism



4246
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:15,359
## veganism is literally defined by



4247
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:16,880
## avoiding animal abuse as much as



4248
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:20,240
## practically possible it's not practical



4249
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:22,240
## to carry out veganism in the way that



4250
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:24,560
## it's being suggested in in all this



4251
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:25,280
## stuff



4252
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:27,439
## it's just that's not practical we're not



4253
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:29,120
## even talking about a scenario where you



4254
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:29,439
## have



4255
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:31,840
## two options in front of you one from a



4256
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:33,120
## vegan company and one



4257
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,880
## is an impossible burger and you have no



4258
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,399
## other food options because you're on a



4259
02:21:36,399 --> 02:21:37,359
## desert



4260
02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:39,439
## uh you're on a deserted island or



4261
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:40,399
## something that's not



4262
02:21:40,399 --> 02:21:43,280
## the scenario we're in here uh because in



4263
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:44,960
## that scenario obviously the better thing



4264
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:45,680
## to do



4265
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:47,520
## would be to choose the product from the



4266
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:49,120
## vegan company



4267
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:52,840
## um but it's not as black and white as



4268
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:54,080
## this



4269
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:56,240
## okay cool all right we'll close that



4270
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:57,359
## chapter we've got



4271
02:21:57,359 --> 02:21:59,760
## just two more topics left and then we'll



4272
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:01,040
## we'll go to a q a



4273
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:02,880
## so um i don't know how many people are



4274
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,080
## left from the beginning but there were a



4275
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:05,600
## lot of questions coming in earlier and



4276
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:06,960
## i'm not prepared to go through the chat



4277
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:08,000
## to find them so



4278
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
## if you have questions uh you're gonna



4279
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,680
## have to save them and type them again



4280
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:12,479
## when we do a quick



4281
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:15,200
## q a um and as i said if you if you're



4282
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:16,479
## planning on asking questions keep it



4283
02:22:16,479 --> 02:22:18,319
## sensible or we just won't answer it



4284
02:22:18,319 --> 02:22:20,560
## it's a waste of your time typing it if



4285
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:22,080
## you're gonna be stupid so



4286
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:24,640
## just keep that in mind um all right the



4287
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:26,240
## last last two points then just



4288
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:28,319
## the first one i want to talk about this



4289
02:22:28,319 --> 02:22:29,600
## it's linked to something we discussed



4290
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:31,200
## earlier actually about the the people



4291
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:32,960
## complaining or claiming they weren't



4292
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,319
## getting funded you know like they



4293
02:22:34,319 --> 02:22:35,520
## weren't getting the



4294
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:38,000
## av fund or whatever and it links into an



4295
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,200
## overall problem of



4296
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:42,960
## organizers in av getting somehow feeling



4297
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:43,439
## that they



4298
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:45,280
## haven't been supported or they feel like



4299
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:46,640
## they haven't been supported by you or



4300
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:47,840
## they feel like they've been actually had



4301
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:48,960
## the opposite like some



4302
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,720
## some ex-organizers go out there and



4303
02:22:50,720 --> 02:22:52,000
## claim that they were actually



4304
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,720
## um i don't know what you would say you



4305
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:56,000
## guys were rude to them or they were



4306
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,520
## treated badly by av



4307
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,479
## and that's why they left or or um they



4308
02:23:00,479 --> 02:23:02,399
## were booted out or something



4309
02:23:02,399 --> 02:23:04,080
## you know and i'm being generic here in



4310
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:05,520
## general because every time i've pushed



4311
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:06,960
## for more information on these



4312
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:09,280
## claims i've had i've had nothing right



4313
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:11,120
## so i'm bringing it up as a general topic



4314
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:12,000
## and you don't need to



4315
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,680
## answer it as if it's like oh this one



4316
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:14,960
## individual or something because they



4317
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:16,399
## never provided me any screenshots or



4318
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:18,399
## anything so i've got nothing to show you



4319
02:23:18,399 --> 02:23:21,520
## um but what why are they doing this why



4320
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:22,880
## do you think this this is coming up from



4321
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:24,640
## ex organizers where they're saying



4322
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:26,640
## i wasn't supported or i was treated



4323
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,560
## badly um



4324
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:30,000
## where where is that coming from do you



4325
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,520
## think there's any truth to it you know



4326
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:34,479
## what are your thoughts on it



4327
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:38,160
## no there's no truth to this because



4328
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:41,760
## we um



4329
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:44,560
## we provide support for every chapter for



4330
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:47,040
## every organizer equally



4331
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:49,120
## right we've got all these different



4332
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:50,960
## things and procedures and



4333
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:54,080
## systems in place that provide support



4334
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:57,680
## from us um to the regional organizers we



4335
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:58,800
## have a manager



4336
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,439
## that manages the regional organizers and



4337
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:02,399
## then



4338
02:24:02,399 --> 02:24:04,399
## so all of the organizers have the



4339
02:24:04,399 --> 02:24:05,840
## ability to reach out to



4340
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:08,720
## us personally in their chat at any



4341
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:10,800
## moment if they need support if they need



4342
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:13,120
## advice if they need any kind of help



4343
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:16,160
## and we always help them and



4344
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:18,800
## we provide support where we can so to



4345
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:21,680
## just leave and say that they felt



4346
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:24,160
## um like they were not supported or they



4347
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:26,080
## were treated badly it's just



4348
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:28,880
## yeah we need to see the evidence because



4349
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:30,720
## it's easy to just make these statements



4350
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,080
## but where is it coming from



4351
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:33,760
## again it's just because people think



4352
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:35,120
## okay i'm going to leave av



4353
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:37,680
## because all these people said paul is



4354
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:40,000
## racist and this and that and so



4355
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,520
## now i'm going to just jump on the



4356
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:44,800
## bandwagon and say abe treated me badly



4357
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,479
## that's the only thing i can think of



4358
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:48,319
## there's no evidence



4359
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:50,560
## right



4360
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,120
## i don't think it's much of a help to



4361
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:57,520
## anybody for us to comment on



4362
02:24:57,520 --> 02:24:58,880
## this any further than that because



4363
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:00,720
## there's no specific
