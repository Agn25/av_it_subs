2094
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,199
## we barely need your name at the cube and



2095
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,320
## uh and



2096
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,320
## that's what we said regarding this whole



2097
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,600
## thing



2098
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,480
## yeah so if if like putting this into



2099
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,159
## real life like if someone actually



2100
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:19,360
## did uh come to a cube and uh



2101
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,440
## let's say it was it was one of your



2102
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,120
## organizers or you whichever



2103
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,320
## and they said okay i when you refer to



2104
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:26,640
## me



2105
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,120
## as like you know if if they are like



2106
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,719
## doing something and that you're talking



2107
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:31,280
## about them



2108
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,719
## like they can't hear you or whatever or



2109
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:33,760
## maybe they're in the conversation



2110
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,600
## whatever they want to be referred to as



2111
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,400
## a she



2112
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,360
## um because now they're a trans woman and



2113
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,719
## and is that something that you would



2114
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,000
## respect



2115
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,360
## or you would tell your organizers to



2116
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,040
## respect or would you tell them no



2117
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,960
## only refer to them by their name like



2118
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,520
## that's his name but if if by respect



2119
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,679
## you mean are we going to then call them



2120
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,719
## a man in their face in order to make a



2121
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:57,280
## point



2122
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,239
## that we reject the notion that they



2123
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,000
## identify as a woman



2124
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,600
## well of course we're not going to do



2125
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,320
## that that that would be impolite



2126
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,880
## and counterproductive for our mission on



2127
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,719
## the streets to begin with



2128
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:13,120
## which is to get on with non-human animal



2129
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,560
## rights activism



2130
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,679
## not get caught up in issues between



2131
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:18,960
## humans human centric



2132
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,159
## issues and the reason why i'm pointing



2133
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,040
## out



2134
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,880
## that i initially started with pointing



2135
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,040
## out that



2136
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,840
## this is clearly ideological is that we



2137
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,080
## don't allow any other



2138
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,159
## political ideologies to be carried out



2139
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,840
## or political agendas to be carried out



2140
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,440
## at the cubes



2141
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,840
## of any kind so when we've never



2142
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,239
## specifically targeted this



2143
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:45,280
## in any way you know it's just across the



2144
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,840
## board not welcome



2145
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,600
## sure and what what what about in the



2146
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,640
## case that someone doesn't actually



2147
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,640
## believe or doesn't really agree with you



2148
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,000
## that it's political because a lot



2149
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,719
## of people who are become become a trans



2150
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,159
## woman or a trans man



2151
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,920
## they don't do it out of some political



2152
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,679
## ideology they do it because they have



2153
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,440
## gender dysphoria right it's a medical



2154
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,320
## condition



2155
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,719
## and them being referred to as a he or



2156
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:07,440
## she



2157
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,719
## um it's nothing to do with their



2158
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,480
## politics is to do with them being



2159
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,640
## like validated as a person right so it's



2160
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,760
## actually really important



2161
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,520
## i know i know there are a lot of trans



2162
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,960
## activists out there who are making this



2163
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,400
## very very political i understand that



2164
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,440
## they exist



2165
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,800
## and there are people who are not even



2166
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,120
## trans who make it political by



2167
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,880
## forcing others to call them a he or she



2168
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,320
## when they've they don't have gender



2169
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,600
## dysphoria you know what i mean i



2170
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,960
## understand this is happening



2171
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,199
## and i understand standing up to that but



2172
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,320
## in the case where these people are



2173
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,360
## genuine



2174
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,480
## um and you know they are asking as a



2175
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,719
## as like a you know as a courtesy to help



2176
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:39,840
## them adapt to



2177
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,560
## this new life for example would that be



2178
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,520
## a policy of av



2179
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,520
## to to tell people right you refer to



2180
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,320
## them as they want to be referred to or



2181
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,239
## is that not a policy navy and it's no



2182
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:51,920
## you just you call them by name and



2183
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,320
## that's it



2184
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,840
## so just to clarify here because i think



2185
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,440
## there's some things being communicated



2186
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,880
## that



2187
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
## in this interaction that might lead



2188
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,560
## people to think that we've commented on



2189
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,840
## trans people when we haven't even



2190
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,120
## commented on trans people



2191
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,400
## at all ever ever



2192
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,719
## uh my comments were only about gender



2193
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,400
## pronouns



2194
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,560
## and uh gender pronouns are a completely



2195
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,320
## different discussion



2196
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,920
## to trans issues gender pronouns are



2197
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,920
## used by people who don't even identify



2198
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,199
## as trans



2199
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,920
## so i'm not talking about trans people



2200
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,360
## i've never talked i've never said



2201
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,880
## anything about trans people and neither



2202
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,000
## is a cell



2203
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,320
## and that needs to be clarified 100 i



2204
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,840
## think because



2205
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,840
## i don't appreciate getting tossed into



2206
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,760
## that category of someone who has spoken



2207
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,360
## about trans people when i haven't said a



2208
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,280
## single word about trans people



2209
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,560
## uh my comments are about my skepticism



2210
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,640
## towards gender pronouns and the use of



2211
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,400
## gender pronouns and then being



2212
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,320
## 50 plus gender pronouns that was my



2213
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,040
## comment



2214
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,840
## and uh this like i said at the cube



2215
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,239
## there's no real need for even



2216
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,360
## even for someone's name so if if



2217
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,760
## this is happening this interaction is



2218
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,960
## happening at a cube



2219
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,640
## where someone is offended because you



2220
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,840
## haven't used their correct gender



2221
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,400
## pronoun



2222
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,560
## that's what i mean by becoming political



2223
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,400
## and someone bringing a political agenda



2224
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,360
## into



2225
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,080
## that space when we don't even really



2226
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:22,800
## require



2227
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,280
## your name so if that discussion is



2228
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,640
## occurring at the cube it's likely



2229
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,320
## because someone is choosing



2230
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,159
## to make a rise out of it and you know to



2231
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,080
## uh to you know



2232
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,320
## obviously if someone is like i said



2233
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,199
## already



2234
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:40,719
## going out of their way to disrespect



2235
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,640
## somebody like this yes we would take



2236
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,840
## issue with that 100



2237
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,760
## we would see that as bullying it would



2238
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,040
## be implied and it would be



2239
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,560
## bullying to say no i don't



2240
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,920
## not only do i not believe what you



2241
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,480
## believe but your belief is stupid



2242
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,760
## that's bullying right so of course we



2243
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,239
## don't condone that
