1786
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,079
## supportive of individuals within our




1787
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,559
## network who are doing that




1788
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,799
## uh




1789
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,839
## i don't see that as activism though i




1790
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,760
## didn't see that as like fighting a human




1791
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,480
## rights cause of some kind




1792
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,960
## no i guess not but i guess it would be




1793
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,319
## raising awareness that




1794
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,000
## homeless people need food i know people




1795
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,079
## know that or maybe inspiring other




1796
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,000
## vegans to go out and outreach




1797
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,599
## homeless people and give them food i




1798
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,040
## don't know it's an idea it's just it's




1799
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,040
## just an idea is what i mean it's it's




1800
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,480
## something that uh




1801
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,400
## um like i don't know if it even would




1802
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,079
## count as intersectionality in that case




1803
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,280
## but for example the




1804
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,920
## lebanon example would because they they




1805
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,119
## have the corrupt government they are




1806
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,640
## they're oppressing their people




1807
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,119
## um making someone making a post or




1808
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,400
## making a video on that where you're




1809
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,520
## saying hey look at what these awesome




1810
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,480
## vegans are doing




1811
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,920
## they're fighting a corrupt government




1812
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,200
## and they're also saving animals and




1813
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,400
## they're getting people food




1814
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,640
## that that would be a better example of




1815
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,480
## of how to raise awareness of




1816
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,440
## two oppressions um in one without either




1817
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,000
## of them




1818
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,599
## losing anything if that makes sense




1819
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,599
## because it's not like we're just talking




1820
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:06,240
## about




1821
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,760
## you know lebanon we're talking about




1822
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,240
## vegan and activists in lebanon so like




1823
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,040
## then it becomes




1824
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,960
## something that encompasses all of it you




1825
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,720
## know but i mean i




1826
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,319
## i'm a bit confused because




1827
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,400
## i don't see how it was like an animal




1828
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,319
## rights




1829
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,359
## uh thing that they did




1830
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,760
## they're just vegans people who don't




1831
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,359
## abuse and torture animals




1832
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,720
## animal rights activists who went and did




1833
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,319
## a deed for humans and that deed




1834
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,680
## was a human rights good




1835
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,319
## that they did and when they were doing




1836
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,680
## that




1837
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,079
## that act that deed had nothing to do




1838
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,280
## with the animals really




1839
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,960
## it was just about i think david was




1840
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,240
## saying that they were kind of




1841
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,040
## outreaching




1842
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,720
## people when they were giving them the




1843
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,079
## food were they




1844
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:55,760
## yeah i believe they were i don't know




1845
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,520
## this for sure but i believe they were




1846
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,039
## sending out like leaflets and stuff with




1847
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,880
## the with the bags and also they were




1848
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,400
## rescuing animals too they were actually




1849
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,760
## rescuing animals off the street and




1850
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,799
## getting them treated




1851
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,720
## they were raising money for that too so




1852
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,240
## they were doing a few yeah it was like




1853
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:08,880
## uh




1854
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,319
## it was yeah they were doing a few little




1855
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:11,760
## a few different things to try and help




1856
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,240
## the animals and also the people




1857
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,920
## yeah i didn't know the full extent of




1858
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,520
## the campaign that they carried out over




1859
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,319
## there




1860
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,559
## uh i all i know is at the time i reached




1861
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,000
## out and you know i checked in with them




1862
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,640
## and i




1863
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,920
## was just wanting to know if they were




1864
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,680
## okay during the whole blast




1865
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,880
## but i forgive my ignorance to




1866
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,680
## those who were carrying out that awesome




1867
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,599
## campaign because it looked very




1868
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,440
## helpful i was just confused on how it




1869
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,960
## was tied into animal rights i just




1870
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,160
## thought they were




1871
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,240
## doing a deed a good deed for humans in




1872
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,000
## that moment




1873
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
## i didn't see how maybe they were maybe




1874
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,599
## they were maybe they were maybe maybe




1875
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,119
## they were only doing that some of them




1876
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,280
## um but i know for sure some of them were




1877
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,799
## also rescuing the animals i guess




1878
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,680
## i mean with a more concrete example if




1879
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,960
## let's imagine there is a concrete




1880
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,480
## example of this where they're actually




1881
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,359
## doing that




1882
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,200
## they're actually advocating for animal




1883
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,119
## rights whilst simultaneously helping




1884
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,000
## humans




1885
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,640
## um i guess the question is like would




1886
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,119
## would




1887
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,760
## that be something av would consider to




1888
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,720
## post about if




1889
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,960
## it came up or or is is there some a




1890
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,400
## reason not to that's what i'm trying to




1891
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,960
## understand




1892
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,440
## like hosting so you're asking




1893
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,960
## specifically about posting about it on




1894
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,440
## social media




1895
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,359
## our platforms are for animal rights for




1896
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,119
## non-human animal rights




1897
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,599
## so that's our general response to that




1898
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:26,559
## but we do




1899
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,240
## carry out what you're saying we do




1900
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,520
## take the opportunity to how did you want




1901
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:33,920
## it




1902
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,920
## to benefit humans while benefiting the




1903
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,160
## animals you know in those moments when




1904
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:38,799
## we see




1905
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,720
## any form of oppression or discrimination




1906
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,960
## occurring within our organization




1907
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,720
## we stamp it out with the quickness and




1908
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,960
## we have a process that we go through




1909
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,000
## to rid it from the organization




1910
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,240
## in those moments we're taking action




1911
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,440
## that benefits humans and the animals




1912
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,119
## we're just not posting about it i guess




1913
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,640
## because our platforms




1914
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,760
## and network is for non-human animals




1915
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,680
## okay i understand i understand so it's




1916
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,760
## kind of like um




1917
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,400
## yeah so your base your base kind of um i




1918
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,160
## don't know what to put it here




1919
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,520
## your let's say default your your focus




1920
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,039
## your




1921
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,119
## baseline i keep using that word is is




1922
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,160
## that you know the




1923
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,799
## the account is for non-humans and that




1924
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:21,680
## that's kind of the be




1925
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,440
## that's it basically that that's how it's




1926
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,280
## going to be like social media




1927
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,960
## and also the cubes it that that's where




1928
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,920
## it's going to stay




1929
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,920
## and that that's your core kind of value




1930
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,200
## basically that's what you're saying here




1931
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,880
## right




1932
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,319
## yeah like again going back to the




1933
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,079
## numbers thing you know three trillion




1934
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,599
## animals every year if you think about




1935
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:40,000
## the amount




1936
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,680
## of victims that are involved in this




1937
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,200
## injustice you know how many more times




1938
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,680
## uh more urgent would you say in terms of




1939
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,720
## the numbers




1940
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,440
## this injustice is than other injustices




1941
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:51,760
## on




1942
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,079
## the planet how many more times more




1943
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,520
## urgent would you say




1944
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,440
## totally it's like it's not a it's not a




1945
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,960
## criticism for me i'm actually just




1946
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,240
## trying to uh you know
