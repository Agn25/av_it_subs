## trolling or abusing anyone in any way

## including if you send a super chat and



44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,600
## you pay for a super chat and it's a spam



45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
## or abuse

## will be handling that



54
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,880
## i hope it doesn't come to that but i



55
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,920
## know a lot of the topics that we're

## years i think i think we've been through



77
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,120
## this a few times or

## i know



89
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,720
## it's not the easiest thing to do um



90
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
## so we can kick off i suppose let's just



91
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
## kick straight in right i mean let's not



92
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
## waste any time we're here for a reason



93
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,239
## let's kick off with the recent there's



94
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,159
## the most recent stuff that's been going



95
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,480
## on



96
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,920
## right now i think most people watching



97
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,599
## are going to be here probably off the



98
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,959
## back of that i think i don't think we



99
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
## need to really introduce what av



100
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
## is and who you are i think anybody



101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
## watching this is going to know that



102
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,840
## already



103
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
## so let's just jump in with the recent



104
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,879
## stuff and



105
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,000
## what's been going on with av with



106
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,920
## the the whole situation with joey the



107
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,080
## situation with animal safe movement



108
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,840
## anita the donor um where are we up to



109
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,560
## with this now



110
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
## could you give us an update on that just



111
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,799
## to kick things off



112
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,480
## so we reached out to the donor to



113
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,879
## find out if this was a genuine



114
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
## um thing you know to



115
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,239
## legitimately continue donating to av



116
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,439
## and they



117
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,040
## replied with more demands



118
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
## on top of everything that was discussed



119
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
## in the videos we put out and everything



120
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,040
## that



121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,799
## joey had mentioned so even more demands



122
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,519
## on top of that



123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,239
## that we had to respond to but we of



124
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,439
## course



125
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
## ourselves had things that we needed to



126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,440
## communicate to the donor



127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
## i mean there's obviously a break in



128
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,120
## trust at this point and we need to have



129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
## a conversation and



130
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,560
## re-establish that trust and things like



131
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,120
## this and we haven't heard back



132
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
## since we've replied so that was over



133
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,160
## almost a month ago now



134
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
## and we haven't heard back what were the



135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,320
## extra



136
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,759
## requirements they were they were giving



137
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,120
## you like what did they add



138
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,400
## one of them was for us to delete these



139
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
## videos that we put up



140
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
## about joey and that that



141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
## was pretty telling of what this was



142
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
## really about



143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,039
## right right and what did they give her
