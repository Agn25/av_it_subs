3001
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,520
## my



3002
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,560
## uh i don't i don't have any uh



3003
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,080
## skin in that game my



3004
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,159
## mission is to tell the truth on behalf



3005
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:15,679
## of the victims because it's the least



3006
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:16,320
## that we can do



3007
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,360
## so that's what i said and that was that



3008
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:19,760
## was



3009
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,840
## uh what people have called me racist



3010
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,040
## over



3011
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,080
## so that was like i mean it's let's let's



3012
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,520
## let's be like that's not [ __ ] here



3013
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,960
## it's definitely something that would be



3014
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,199
## considered to be like insensitive



3015
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,920
## but but that's not your the goal isn't



3016
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,880
## to be sensitive



3017
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,199
## um a lot you know it's i don't think



3018
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,639
## being insensitive is necessarily



3019
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,159
## something negative i think sometimes it



3020
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:41,119
## needs to be



3021
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:43,119
## um like that but but how is that



3022
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:45,119
## translating to racism like if somebody



3023
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:45,920
## said paul



3024
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,159
## you're [ __ ] insensitive i i wouldn't



3025
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:49,440
## i don't think i'd even bring that up



3026
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,080
## because it's like



3027
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,560
## well yeah that's obvious like you you



3028
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,360
## know your outreach videos tend to be



3029
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,360
## towards the side of insensitivity and



3030
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,719
## more towards the side of like



3031
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,480
## straight direct like you're gonna get



3032
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,840
## the message whether it pisses you off or



3033
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,520
## not right if you're being sensitive



3034
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,360
## you would dress it up and be nice but



3035
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,560
## you're not being and that's not



3036
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,400
## something to criticize in my opinion or



3037
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,199
## it is whatever



3038
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,480
## but that's not the point here the point



3039
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,800
## is racism so how does that translate to



3040
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,600
## racism



3041
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,960
## how do you think someone gets it from



3042
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,840
## that video that that's you



3043
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,280
## somehow you know disrespecting somebody



3044
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:19,840
## because of



3045
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,800
## their ethnicity just because of her skin



3046
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,679
## color right



3047
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:26,239
## well no no again no it's not just well



3048
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:27,840
## it's not just that you are speaking



3049
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,440
## to a white woman would would you get



3050
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,600
## no of course not but it's not just that



3051
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:34,560
## it's also



3052
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,560
## the fact what people are overlooking



3053
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,920
## here



3054
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,080
## is if if we are going to entertain the



3055
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,920
## notion that there is insensitivity at



3056
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,199
## play here



3057
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:44,880
## people are overlooking the fact that she



3058
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,199
## was being incredibly insensitive to the



3059
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:48,800
## animal victims that she



3060
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,360
## is an oppressor of directly responsible



3061
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,760
## for victimizing herself



3062
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,719
## and so that's where it started that's



3063
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:58,960
## where the context of all of this began



3064
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,679
## i was responding to her not by saying



3065
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:02,719
## [ __ ] black



3066
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:04,960
## people and [ __ ] black rights but by



3067
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:05,760
## saying



3068
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,440
## animals are the most oppressed group of



3069
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,960
## beings on the planet



3070
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,480
## if me pointing out a fact is insensitive



3071
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,119
## while she's literally saying [ __ ] the



3072
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:16,320
## animals



3073
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,600
## and [ __ ] their rights well



3074
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,639
## i guess you need to ask yourself



3075
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,440
## which like what does it take for you to



3076
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,280
## see injustice for what it is



3077
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,880
## especially when it's to the degree that



3078
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,840
## it is he in this case with the animals



3079
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,760
## when they're subjected to the most



3080
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,960
## brutal



3081
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,800
## violence that has ever been carried out



3082
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,719
## on any group of beings ever



3083
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,480
## what does it take for people to to just



3084
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,800
## literally just acknowledge them and to



3085
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,080
## acknowledge



3086
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:49,119
## the fact that they are subjected



3087
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,199
## to oppression to the extent that they



3088
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,159
## are subjected



3089
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:54,400
## to that oppression and for simply just



3090
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,159
## simply for people to simply



3091
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,560
## say that for people to simply speak



3092
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,000
## about that



3093
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,320
## if that's offensive we have no hope as a



3094
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,840
## species evolving



3095
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,440
## and developing into better ways of



3096
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:11,040
## of living on this planet and uh



3097
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,280
## with truly addressing injustice and



3098
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,800
## oppression on this planet it's never



3099
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,520
## going to happen



3100
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:18,000
## unless we change the way we think around



3101
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,560
## things like this



3102
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:23,760
## yeah i i i think honestly



3103
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,320
## my opinion on this is like to label that



3104
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,239
## as racism



3105
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:31,840
## is is offensive um to



3106
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,520
## it's offensive because it's not even



3107
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,600
## offensive it's it's harmful



3108
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,239
## because it confuses what actual racism



3109
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:39,199
## is



3110
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,920
## right how how can you call like this is



3111
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,400
## this



3112
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,840
## when you really lay it out like this



3113
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,239
## right you've got two people of color



3114
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,080
## you're not white so two people of color



3115
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,560
## having a conversation about the animals



3116
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:53,360
## and one of the people says that you know



3117
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,199
## the reality about the animals



3118
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:58,080
## and somehow that person is racist it's



3119
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,600
## just such a strange thing to



3120
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,880
## call racism over and it completely



3121
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,480
## takes away the meaning of the word and



3122
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,000
## i've said this before people get really



3123
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,320
## upset about it that the more you use the



3124
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,199
## word racist



3125
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,440
## sexist transphobe the more difficult it



3126
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,360
## becomes to actually identify



3127
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:16,719
## racists sexists and transphobes and and



3128
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:17,199
## i think



3129
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:19,119
## nowadays we're in a position where it's



3130
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:20,400
## like you said who hasn't been called a



3131
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,119
## racist



3132
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:24,480
## um or a transphobe or a sexist in 2020



3133
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,199
## practically anyone who has dared to even



3134
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,639
## question the narrative



3135
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:30,159
## has been called one of those things it's



3136
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:32,320
## either you you do what you're told



3137
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,320
## and you say what you're supposed to say



3138
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,000
## or that's what you get branded with



3139
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,239
## do you know how harmful that is to the



3140
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,400
## people who actually suffer from sexism



3141
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,480
## racism and transphobia



3142
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,520
## the fact that you know that label is so



3143
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,080
## used so flippantly if you could you



3144
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,199
## could say that for every



3145
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,679
## every other label that is thrown around



3146
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:52,639
## um



3147
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:57,199
## to to to to try and cancel others



3148
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:00,000
## when uh when baseless whether it's the
