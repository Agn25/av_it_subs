5129
02:50:01,439 --> 02:50:02,640
## about nuance




5130
02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:05,520
## uh like if hitler shows up to the cube




5131
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:06,720
## should he be respected




5132
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:10,240
## like if he just is resurrected from from




5133
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:11,200
## the earth




5134
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:12,880
## uh comes back to life and shows up to




5135
02:50:12,880 --> 02:50:14,880
## keep will he be respected




5136
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:17,760
## uh uh do i have to answer that well we




5137
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:18,160
## said




5138
02:50:18,160 --> 02:50:21,200
## everyone should be respected we said we




5139
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:22,720
## meant the person




5140
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:26,479
## who chooses a different pronoun or name




5141
02:50:26,479 --> 02:50:28,800
## as well as the person who might disagree




5142
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:30,800
## with that ideology




5143
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:32,640
## oppressed that's what we meant we didn't




5144
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:34,399
## say the bully




5145
02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:37,680
## or the oppressor so oppression is not




5146
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:38,800
## respected




5147
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:41,520
## i thought that like because we led into




5148
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:42,640
## that point




5149
02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:46,000
## with saying that actually and




5150
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,359
## so yeah no totally totally i i




5151
02:50:49,359 --> 02:50:51,200
## understand this is i think i watched a




5152
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:51,840
## uh




5153
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:53,600
## this thing with uh bilbao you know the




5154
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:55,040
## comedian bilbao




5155
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:56,960
## he he he was talking about new ones as




5156
02:50:56,960 --> 02:50:58,319
## well do you know the ginger guy




5157
02:50:58,319 --> 02:50:59,840
## and speaks really quickly i don't know




5158
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:00,960
## if you know what i'm talking about yeah




5159
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:01,359
## cool




5160
02:51:01,359 --> 02:51:03,200
## so he he talked about nuance as well and




5161
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:04,720
## he was saying that like




5162
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:07,439
## everything i say is twisted and he said




5163
02:51:07,439 --> 02:51:08,240
## something like




5164
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:09,680
## he said he was talking about consent




5165
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:11,760
## right and i'm gonna by the way




5166
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:13,040
## for anyone that's looking for something




5167
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:14,880
## to get me on here this is bill burr's




5168
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:16,720
## words not my words all right don't




5169
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:19,040
## [ __ ] start here um but basically he




5170
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:19,600
## said




5171
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:21,359
## like today's world like how how do you




5172
02:51:21,359 --> 02:51:23,040
## even work right so he said like it's all




5173
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:24,160
## about consent and there's




5174
02:51:24,160 --> 02:51:25,840
## you're at risk all the way always and he




5175
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:27,200
## said how do you




5176
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,120
## have it rough now like if a girl wants




5177
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:30,720
## it rough how do you do that




5178
02:51:30,720 --> 02:51:33,200
## because you know how does it work right




5179
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:34,800
## and this guy in the crowd shouted




5180
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:37,359
## you need to get consent first and he was




5181
02:51:37,359 --> 02:51:38,160
## like




5182
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:40,479
## this is why you can't make jokes anymore




5183
02:51:40,479 --> 02:51:42,399
## he was like this [ __ ] [ __ ]




5184
02:51:42,399 --> 02:51:44,720
## thinks that i'm saying that i was not




5185
02:51:44,720 --> 02:51:46,720
## going to get consent i never said that




5186
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:48,240
## he was like when did i say that why




5187
02:51:48,240 --> 02:51:49,520
## would you assume that that's what i




5188
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:49,840
## meant




5189
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:51,840
## right and he was like it's [ __ ]




5190
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:53,760
## ridiculous you assumed the worst of me




5191
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:55,200
## and he called this guy an idiot and a




5192
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:57,040
## [ __ ] and like really slammed him




5193
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:58,720
## for shouting that because it's like i'm




5194
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:00,720
## not a monster dude like i'm making a




5195
02:52:00,720 --> 02:52:01,600
## joke about




5196
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:03,279
## rough sex i'm not making a joke about




5197
02:52:03,279 --> 02:52:05,359
## not getting consent are you insane




5198
02:52:05,359 --> 02:52:06,800
## there's a very big difference and this




5199
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:08,880
## is i'm saying it because he commented on




5200
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:10,080
## it and it's kind of what's just happened




5201
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:11,600
## here it's like you guys said respect




5202
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:13,840
## everyone and someone understood that as




5203
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:14,640
## respect




5204
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:16,960
## transphobic people it's like no that's




5205
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:17,680
## not what i




5206
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:21,120
## said no one said that jesus do you think




5207
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:22,720
## i would have let that fly




5208
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:24,319
## in the conversation do you really think




5209
02:52:24,319 --> 02:52:25,840
## i am that morally




5210
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:27,359
## corrupt that i would just let someone




5211
02:52:27,359 --> 02:52:28,960
## say that on my channel and just not




5212
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:30,319
## question wait a minute you've just said




5213
02:52:30,319 --> 02:52:31,680
## you want to respect transphobes it's




5214
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:32,479
## like no




5215
02:52:32,479 --> 02:52:34,640
## i would never let that go even if i had




5216
02:52:34,640 --> 02:52:36,800
## someone like some monster on the channel




5217
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:38,880
## i would never let that go but that's not




5218
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:40,560
## the case you know




5219
02:52:40,560 --> 02:52:41,760
## anyway i'm just i've just got off the




5220
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:43,200
## handle a bit there but we're at the end




5221
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:45,920
## anyway it's fine




5222
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:49,600
## it's just as silly as having to say




5223
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:52,720
## oh with the exception of intersex




5224
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:54,479
## when you're saying there's two sexes




5225
02:52:54,479 --> 02:52:56,319
## like why should we even have to say that




5226
02:52:56,319 --> 02:52:58,080
## it's an anomaly of course that's an




5227
02:52:58,080 --> 02:52:59,520
## exception to the rule




5228
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:03,279
## and like you know




5229
02:53:03,279 --> 02:53:04,880
## you don't need to say certain things i




5230
02:53:04,880 --> 02:53:06,479
## guess if you are




5231
02:53:06,479 --> 02:53:09,439
## reading between the lines and you are uh




5232
02:53:09,439 --> 02:53:10,000
## attuned




5233
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,720
## to nuance and you don't just see things




5234
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:13,600
## through




5235
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:16,880
## this uh cancel culture lens where




5236
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:19,040
## you know is it what what billboard said




5237
02:53:19,040 --> 02:53:21,439
## is these days you say something and what




5238
02:53:21,439 --> 02:53:23,200
## you say goes into someone's brain and




5239
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:24,720
## then it gets cut




5240
02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:26,720
## with all of the things that they're




5241
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:28,560
## conditioned with




5242
02:53:28,560 --> 02:53:31,120
## and you know and then it comes out of




5243
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:33,359
## their brain they spit it out after that




5244
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:34,960
## you know according to what they perceive




5245
02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:36,399
## it to be and it's usually completely




5246
02:53:36,399 --> 02:53:37,359
## different to what




5247
02:53:37,359 --> 02:53:42,000
## you said and uh it's the same thing here




5248
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,200
## it shouldn't that shouldn't that's




5249
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:44,640
## something that shouldn't in my opinion




5250
02:53:44,640 --> 02:53:46,080
## shouldn't need to be clarified you




5251
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:47,840
## should assume the best in people not the




5252
02:53:47,840 --> 02:53:48,800
## worst




5253
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:51,279
## i i don't understand what you what you




5254
02:53:51,279 --> 02:53:52,960
## have done or even what i have done




5255
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:54,240
## because i'm involved in this that




5256
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:55,840
## question was for all of us right because




5257
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:56,240
## i




5258
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:58,720
## they're assuming that you have said that




5259
02:53:58,720 --> 02:53:59,840
## and i have




5260
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:02,160
## i have been like yeah great cool like




5261
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:03,760
## what did i do to deserve that what did




5262
02:54:03,760 --> 02:54:05,680
## you do to deserve that assumption like i




5263
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:06,720
## i don't think any of us has done




5264
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:08,720
## anything particularly you know that




5265
02:54:08,720 --> 02:54:10,800
## horrible to think that any of us would




5266
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:12,800
## like believe that or let it go it's such




5267
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:13,920
## a strange




5268
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:15,439
## and i think the person's saying it




5269
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:16,640
## innocently enough i don't think they're




5270
02:54:16,640 --> 02:54:17,359
## trying to attack




5271
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:19,680
## but at the same time it's like dude be




5272
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:21,359
## reasonable here come on




5273
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:24,800
## it's a fair enough question um but




5274
02:54:24,800 --> 02:54:26,800
## i mean i i don't know is it fair enough




5275
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:28,640
## actually am i trying to be nice




5276
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:29,920
## i don't think it's fair enough at all in




5277
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:31,600
## my opinion i think it's something that




5278
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:33,359
## if you watched the whole conversation




5279
02:54:33,359 --> 02:54:34,160
## and listened




5280
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:36,319
## without assuming the worst in all three




5281
02:54:36,319 --> 02:54:38,160
## of us you would come to the conclusion




5282
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:39,359
## that that that's not




5283
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:41,439
## what was being said like that you're not




5284
02:54:41,439 --> 02:54:42,720
## going to respect a bigger you're not




5285
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:44,560
## going to respect someone who hates trans




5286
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:45,920
## people like




5287
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:47,760
## what the [ __ ] like what kind of rational




5288
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:49,200
## person would ever




5289
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:51,439
## have irrational hatred or acceptance of




5290
02:54:51,439 --> 02:54:52,640
## irrational hatred




5291
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:54,960
## like it's not it's not rational to




5292
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:55,920
## accept that




5293
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:58,000
## and we've i don't believe we've been




5294
02:54:58,000 --> 02:54:59,840
## acting irrationally in this conversation




5295
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:00,240
## so i
