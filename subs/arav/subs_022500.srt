4364
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:04,160
## thing to that we're responding to yeah



4365
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:06,640
## i'm just trying to get it you know i i



4366
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:08,000
## agree with you i don't like bringing



4367
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:08,479
## this up



4368
02:25:08,479 --> 02:25:10,720
## because there's no i've got nothing to



4369
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:12,240
## show you know what i mean and i feel



4370
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:12,880
## like



4371
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:14,560
## i've had multiple conversations i've had



4372
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:15,840
## conversations i'll be honest with you



4373
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:17,120
## i've had conversations with people that



4374
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:19,120
## i would consider to be good friends



4375
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:21,760
## and i've had to be quite harsh and say



4376
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:22,240
## look



4377
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:24,800
## either give me something here or you're



4378
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:25,520
## full of [ __ ]



4379
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:27,680
## hey i'm sorry and we've kind of like got



4380
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:28,960
## into an argument and just



4381
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:30,720
## agreed to disagree on it because they



4382
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:32,240
## wouldn't give it to me because they



4383
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:33,439
## didn't have it



4384
02:25:33,439 --> 02:25:36,000
## and um so i've got to say i i hold i



4385
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,520
## hold a bit of a bias on this because



4386
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:38,560
## i've experienced



4387
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:40,479
## the [ __ ] first hand and it's it's



4388
02:25:40,479 --> 02:25:41,920
## really disappointing to see



4389
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:43,600
## and it kind of happens to me as well



4390
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:45,200
## obviously people say things about me and



4391
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:46,319
## i'll say okay great give me some



4392
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:47,840
## evidence tell me where i've said that



4393
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:51,359
## and they disappear you know um so i



4394
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:53,600
## it's it's it's a it's a symptom of a



4395
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,200
## larger problem i think



4396
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:58,479
## um yeah yeah



4397
02:25:58,479 --> 02:26:01,359
## for sure yeah and then the final the



4398
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:03,600
## final thing we'll go into then



4399
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:05,359
## is actually about the effectiveness of



4400
02:26:05,359 --> 02:26:06,960
## av so this is a good thing or not just



4401
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:08,960
## av but of animal rights activism of the



4402
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,399
## activism that we're doing so



4403
02:26:10,399 --> 02:26:12,720
## somebody did message me and they told me



4404
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:14,160
## um ask them



4405
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,520
## they started off with a shitty message



4406
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:17,520
## they said ask them why why the cube of



4407
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:18,800
## truth doesn't work



4408
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:20,880
## so i was like okay what are you talking



4409
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:22,240
## about they said right look the



4410
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:23,680
## number of animals being killed is on the



4411
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:25,760
## rise and um



4412
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:27,840
## the challenge 22 sign ups for last year



4413
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,359
## i think it was last year was only 2



4414
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:31,680
## 000 in the entire world so clearly it's



4415
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:33,439
## not working so i broke that down into



4416
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:34,960
## two sections and this is two things i



4417
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:36,160
## want to go through like



4418
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:38,240
## one side of this is that obviously if



4419
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:39,760
## the number of animals being killed is



4420
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:41,040
## increasing it's not just av



4421
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:42,880
## that's not working it's every single



4422
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:44,319
## activism group that's not working



4423
02:26:44,319 --> 02:26:45,200
## because



4424
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:47,520
## clearly you know save isn't working dxe



4425
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:48,800
## isn't working direct action isn't



4426
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:50,080
## working hunts abs aren't working



4427
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:51,359
## nothing's working because the amount of



4428
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:52,960
## animals being killed is on the increase



4429
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:53,680
## right



4430
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:56,319
## so that's that's a topic why is that



4431
02:26:56,319 --> 02:26:56,960
## happening



4432
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:58,479
## um you know what can we do about it as



4433
02:26:58,479 --> 02:27:00,399
## one topic and the other topic is



4434
02:27:00,399 --> 02:27:04,240
## um why the um challenge the vegan 22



4435
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:06,800
## av signups um they seem to be a lot



4436
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:07,439
## lower than



4437
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:10,080
## what would be expected of a of you know



4438
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:11,840
## considering how much work goes in into



4439
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:13,040
## the cubes right



4440
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:14,399
## so i think let's maybe start with the



4441
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:15,840
## challenge 22 one because that might be



4442
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,280
## an easier quicker one to go into and



4443
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:18,640
## then we'll close on the



4444
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:20,800
## on the set on the other one so what with



4445
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,399
## the challenge 22 reporting



4446
02:27:22,399 --> 02:27:24,720
## um firstly is that accurate like what's



4447
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:25,840
## going on with that or



4448
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,680
## how is it only at 2 000 for like the



4449
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:29,200
## whole year



4450
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:31,680
## nah first of all it's not accurate



4451
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:34,080
## because many people wouldn't use it also



4452
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:35,920
## at some point we stopped promoting it



4453
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:37,600
## and using it anyway



4454
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,080
## because we realized that challenge 22 is



4455
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:41,600
## now really aligned with av



4456
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:44,720
## in terms of how they promote veganism



4457
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:47,920
## and so we stopped promoting it



4458
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:49,920
## and maybe some organizers some



4459
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:51,439
## volunteers are still



4460
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:53,439
## using that link when they arrest someone



4461
02:27:53,439 --> 02:27:55,600
## at a cube but



4462
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,840
## it's not being done the same way anyway



4463
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:58,880
## i think



4464
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:01,280
## when did we start doing this when we



4465
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:02,960
## when did we stop using



4466
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:06,160
## the link last year at least



4467
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:08,720
## a year and a half yeah wait it's it



4468
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:10,640
## could even be up to two years now but



4469
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:10,960
## it's



4470
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:12,640
## at least a year yeah i think it was last



4471
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:14,800
## year at some point we realized that



4472
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:16,800
## we're just not aligned we stopped using



4473
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:18,240
## it and um



4474
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:20,399
## even when we were promoting it and it



4475
02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:21,600
## was on the card



4476
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:23,520
## i can average someone and i can say you



4477
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:25,200
## know you can go and sign up



4478
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:28,240
## and use this link but that person is not



4479
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:30,080
## necessarily going to do it even if they



4480
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,920
## do decide that they want to be vegan so



4481
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:33,760
## that's why it's not a good measurement



4482
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:36,000
## and we all the way that we communicate



4483
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,280
## animal rights to people



4484
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:40,399
## is so simple and easy to digest and



4485
02:28:40,399 --> 02:28:42,800
## with so much personal individual



4486
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:44,960
## accountability attached to it



4487
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:48,080
## that the why factor is is something we



4488
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:48,560
## focus



4489
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:51,359
## so heavily on hammering into people that



4490
02:28:51,359 --> 02:28:52,080
## the how



4491
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:55,600
## factor is something we empower



4492
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:57,920
## generally we empower other the the



4493
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:00,080
## bystander to take on



4494
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:01,600
## within their accountability it's their



4495
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:03,120
## responsibility to be



4496
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:06,720
## to be to you know properly plan how



4497
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:08,160
## they're going to be vegan by



4498
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:10,720
## simply using google and we we sometimes



4499
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:12,560
## say exactly that you know google is all



4500
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:13,600
## you really need to be



4501
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:16,560
## to be vegan uh we want it to be simple



4502
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:18,000
## for people we don't want to make it



4503
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,600
## sound like you need to be in a 22-day



4504
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:20,080
## program



4505
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:22,640
## when that's not even true you don't the



4506
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:23,520
## fact is



4507
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:26,080
## you do not need that is it helpful for



4508
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:27,120
## some people



4509
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:28,720
## but not for everyone and that's not the



4510
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:30,399
## message that we believe



4511
02:29:30,399 --> 02:29:32,560
## is important we need to clarify it



4512
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:33,600
## further by saying



4513
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:36,800
## all that's needed is the why factor the



4514
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:37,280
## how



4515
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,280
## you will figure out if there were vegans



4516
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:41,200
## 50 years ago



4517
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:44,240
## you can be vegan now



4518
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:47,120
## absolutely okay i think i think that's



4519
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:48,479
## i'll give you my personal opinion on



4520
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:50,000
## that as well because i think that's fair



4521
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,720
## um and i think i don't know to gauge the



4522
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:53,359
## success



4523
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:56,479
## or or failure by how many challenge 22



4524
02:29:56,479 --> 02:29:57,680
## sign ups seems a little bit



4525
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:59,760
## there are seems a bit short-sighted uh



4526
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:01,920
## considering that you know
