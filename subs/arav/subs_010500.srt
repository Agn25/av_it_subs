1947
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,440
## clarify yeah no no maybe that



1948
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,839
## was framed like i was like being



1949
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:06,559
## defensive



1950
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,240
## but i'm asking a genuine question



1951
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,359
## because my next thing i was going to say



1952
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:14,640
## because i say that to say this



1953
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:20,079
## like that's how much more



1954
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,960
## urgent it is for us to maintain a focus



1955
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,799
## on using those platforms for that reason



1956
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,559
## so it's not you know okay



1957
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,079
## yeah totally i i don't i don't see



1958
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,480
## it as a a negative the reason i got into



1959
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,319
## this this discussion now is because i



1960
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,079
## i personally i i see some benefit in



1961
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,680
## that for myself personally that's why i



1962
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,039
## make some of the videos i make where i



1963
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,079
## talk about



1964
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,400
## vegans doing good work also for people i



1965
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,400
## see some benefit in it and and that's my



1966
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:44,880
## choice



1967
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,640
## but that doesn't by default mean that



1968
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,920
## your choice is wrong



1969
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,839
## and i think this is um it's very



1970
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,280
## important for anyone that watched this



1971
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,480
## section and thinks



1972
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,240
## oh but you know but some people are



1973
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,119
## going to agree with you and they'll be



1974
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,799
## like no keep keep the people off



1975
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,880
## right i just just keep keep it really



1976
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,240
## really focused and some people are going



1977
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,599
## to agree with me and say well



1978
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,960
## there's no harm in doing this and maybe



1979
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,720
## it will help and that's totally fine to



1980
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,079
## have different opinions



1981
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,640
## um it doesn't mean one of us is wrong



1982
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,400
## and deserves to be cancelled and the



1983
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,039
## others



1984
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,960
## are you know deserve to be celebrated



1985
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,960
## it's just you align with who you align



1986
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,240
## with and if you're aligned with paul and



1987
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,599
## asylum this then you



1988
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,200
## great keep you do that for your page and



1989
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,440
## if you align with me then great you do



1990
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,720
## what i said and if you don't align with



1991
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,400
## either of us then i don't know alive



1992
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,440
## with someone else and do



1993
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,520
## do that then it's it's not um this isn't



1994
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,880
## a case of being right or wrong i just



1995
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,400
## wanted to see what you thought about it



1996
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,200
## on this specific example the specific



1997
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,000
## topic



1998
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,920
## okay cool um let's let's uh



1999
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,359
## all right let's go to a more direct



2000
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,599
## thing then because i've got a few like



2001
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,920
## let's say more direct accusations direct



2002
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,039
## uh rumors



2003
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,839
## and um we talked about humans quite a



2004
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:48,400
## lot now



2005
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,720
## and actually um it's kind of shitty that



2006
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,480
## i bring the co-founders of anonymous for



2007
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,839
## the voiceless on and we just talk about



2008
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,640
## people



2009
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,640
## but um that's what we came here for uh



2010
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,920
## maybe we can do another live stream



2011
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,599
## where we actually get into the



2012
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,920
## you know into animal rights and activism



2013
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,839
## and really you know go for that i think



2014
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:04,960
## that would be nice to do



2015
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,760
## um to kind of balance having to talk



2016
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,799
## about this



2017
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:12,319
## for such a long time but um



2018
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,839
## these uh main accusations we've had and



2019
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,119
## this also comes in with the



2020
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,640
## intersectionality and also comes in with



2021
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,240
## the things you just discussed about your



2022
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,760
## uh your policies



2023
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,400
## um the number one that came up multiple



2024
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,280
## times was



2025
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,240
## accusations of transphobia and pronouns



2026
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:28,640
## and



2027
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,799
## you've dealt with this uh obviously paul



2028
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,559
## you've dealt with this personally and



2029
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:32,880
## you've



2030
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,039
## spoken about this in other places but we



2031
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,039
## are going to talk about it a bit here



2032
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,079
## and some specific



2033
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,839
## questions um somebody's asked the



2034
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,160
## question



2035
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,240
## uh well i'll go for like the longer one



2036
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,359
## actually there's a few questions but



2037
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,799
## this one's actually quite a well



2038
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,200
## written one so they said and they left



2039
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,520
## av this individual because



2040
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,799
## um because apparently av was focusing on



2041
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,319
## they said focusing on the animals



2042
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,160
## instead of encouraging respect between



2043
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,119
## activists



2044
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,160
## uh they said that there was a situation



2045
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,039
## where you guys decided to call people by



2046
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,160
## birth names



2047
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,599
## rather than calling people by their



2048
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,520
## preferred pronouns and for them



2049
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,559
## this was extremely offensive and wrong



2050
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,440
## um and the discussion around the pronoun



2051
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,359
## politics or what you called uh



2052
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,359
## i think you call it something like uh



2053
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:20,640
## identity politics



2054
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,279
## um they found this to be a lot of people



2055
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,040
## i guess found this to be



2056
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,880
## controversial or controversial enough



2057
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,719
## for them to leave av



2058
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,839
## or at least not go to cubes anymore so



2059
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,000
## i guess the question is um why



2060
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
## why why is that why is this decision



2061
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,520
## been made to



2062
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,000
## not use people's pronouns and use their



2063
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,600
## first names instead



2064
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,920
## even if they want to be referred to by a



2065
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,319
## pronoun



2066
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,839
## i guess i'll answer because there's our



2067
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,600
## main interaction yeah



2068
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,319
## uh gender pronouns are clearly



2069
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,399
## ideological



2070
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:05,279
## and uh we don't



2071
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,279
## so you're just specifically asking about



2072
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,479
## the cubes



2073
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,359
## like in nab i guess yeah let's keep it



2074
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:12,960
## focused on like cubes av



2075
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,640
## yeah yeah so



2076
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,238
## i've never like



2077
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,158
## personally being asked to refer to



2078
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,759
## someone as



2079
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,439
## a particular like



2080
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:31,279
## name and uh



2081
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,679
## where where i've refused to call them



2082
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,040
## that name that's never happened



2083
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,839
## you know it's obviously the polite thing



2084
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:40,479
## to do



2085
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:45,040
## to use the requested name of someone



2086
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,600
## but at cubes we don't even really need



2087
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,279
## your name



2088
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,439
## so it makes no sense for us to apply a



2089
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,319
## protocol



2090
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,600
## regarding one's gender



2091
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,280
## so we don't even have a protocol



2092
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,800
## regarding gender at all



2093
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,159
## because it's not required it's
