4527
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:03,920
## you see conversations with someone like



4528
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:05,280
## you know hudson for example



4529
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,040
## he was a great activist and some of his



4530
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:09,040
## conversations just you blow someone's



4531
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:10,399
## mind you know and



4532
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:12,240
## do they sign up for vegan 22 maybe not



4533
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:14,080
## but but their mind has been blown



4534
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:16,399
## like you know you can't undo that like



4535
02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:18,880
## maybe they don't do vegan 22 but



4536
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,399
## the idea that they could potentially go



4537
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:22,319
## vegan is still is still there you know



4538
02:30:22,319 --> 02:30:23,680
## they've definitely



4539
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:25,760
## made some connections so i think



4540
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:27,200
## engaging the success



4541
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:28,800
## based on that is is a little bit well



4542
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,640
## not a little bit it's very short-sighted



4543
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:32,000
## and it does it does bring up the



4544
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,319
## question though of of how can we gauge



4545
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:35,359
## success right



4546
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:36,800
## because currently this leads on to the



4547
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,720
## next question that we can gauge our



4548
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,399
## failure by the amount of animals being



4549
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:42,319
## killed on the rise right so that



4550
02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:43,600
## that's something i feel like we all have



4551
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,439
## to take as a bit of a slap in the face



4552
02:30:45,439 --> 02:30:46,319
## like okay



4553
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:48,560
## we're trying but you know clearly



4554
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:50,560
## something isn't working as effectively



4555
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:51,680
## as we'd like it to be



4556
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:54,319
## or we've got a long way to go right um



4557
02:30:54,319 --> 02:30:56,319
## so how can we gauge success how can we



4558
02:30:56,319 --> 02:30:57,280
## know that we're



4559
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:59,680
## we're working towards you know the right



4560
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:00,560
## place when



4561
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:02,160
## it looks like we're not if you look at



4562
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:05,200
## the global statistic



4563
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:09,200
## hey look i would agree that animals and



4564
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:10,640
## the animal rights movement has been



4565
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:12,479
## pushed back even further this year than



4566
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:14,000
## it was last year



4567
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,960
## i would agree with that



4568
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:20,080
## all right yeah but to say that we



4569
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:21,439
## shouldn't fight for animals in the way



4570
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:23,680
## that we're doing it is ridiculous



4571
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:27,439
## uh i i would judge incremental wins



4572
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:30,880
## by saying that you know in our network



4573
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:31,680
## i'm seeing



4574
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:34,399
## more and more people than ever before



4575
02:31:34,399 --> 02:31:35,200
## speaking



4576
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:36,880
## correctly about this and that's



4577
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:39,359
## beautiful okay



4578
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:40,880
## we're ending human supremacy we're



4579
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:42,319
## holding people accountable and we're



4580
02:31:42,319 --> 02:31:43,760
## spreading a clear



4581
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:46,880
## vegan message on behalf of the animals



4582
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:49,520
## so for me that's what that's one win



4583
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:50,560
## that i would use



4584
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:52,640
## as an indicator for us moving in the



4585
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:53,600
## right direction



4586
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:56,000
## and i think more and more vegans are



4587
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,520
## taking on board this



4588
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:01,200
## this need to to



4589
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:04,240
## be serious about how we're



4590
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:06,880
## being perceived by others and like



4591
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:08,720
## taking that seriously and being wanting



4592
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:10,319
## wanting to be taken seriously when it



4593
02:32:10,319 --> 02:32:11,760
## comes to this



4594
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:15,600
## uh i don't even think that many



4595
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:17,359
## others are really even taking that into



4596
02:32:17,359 --> 02:32:19,040
## account



4597
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,520
## but i think more and more people are



4598
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:22,479
## actually



4599
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:24,319
## on boarding this attitude which i think



4600
02:32:24,319 --> 02:32:26,000
## is another great indicator



4601
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,560
## uh i think there are other great



4602
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:30,080
## indicators we could point at



4603
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:33,120
## but i guess it depends on the way you



4604
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:33,600
## see it



4605
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:35,439
## and i guess also whether you're an



4606
02:32:35,439 --> 02:32:37,600
## optimist or you're a pessimist



4607
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:42,319
## and um and



4608
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:43,840
## we don't think that you should just do



4609
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:46,080
## one thing anyway like people should do



4610
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,439
## what they think is effective and they



4611
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:48,800
## should be as effective as they can



4612
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,560
## possibly be doing it



4613
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:53,439
## and uh we need people fighting in



4614
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:54,560
## politics



4615
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:56,399
## we need people fighting in government we



4616
02:32:56,399 --> 02:32:58,080
## need people fighting in corporate we



4617
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:00,000
## need people fighting on the streets



4618
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,280
## we need people fighting in hollywood



4619
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:05,200
## it doesn't stop this fight is is



4620
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:06,960
## multi-faceted and it needs to continue



4621
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:09,439
## at every level



4622
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:11,680
## yeah absolutely i think also something



4623
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:13,200
## that's not being considered



4624
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:16,240
## is that although some countries uh there



4625
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:17,359
## may be reductions



4626
02:33:17,359 --> 02:33:19,760
## in how much how much animal products are



4627
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:21,120
## being produced right or how many people



4628
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:22,080
## are consuming them



4629
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:24,720
## or using them um whereas other countries



4630
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:25,520
## are on the rise



4631
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:28,160
## like for example unfortunately india is



4632
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:29,200
## one of those countries



4633
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:30,720
## uh where i know we have a few indians



4634
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:32,560
## here in the chat who can you can also



4635
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:34,319
## you know vouch for this that the amount



4636
02:33:34,319 --> 02:33:36,399
## of animal products specifically meat



4637
02:33:36,399 --> 02:33:38,160
## uh being consumed in india is actually



4638
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:40,240
## increasing and there are other countries



4639
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:42,160
## uh especially in the east who are having



4640
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:44,000
## the same situation previously they had



4641
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,600
## very low consumption and



4642
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:47,280
## now because of the western influence



4643
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:49,200
## they are consuming more whereas it seems



4644
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:49,520
## like



4645
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:51,040
## some western countries are on the flip



4646
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:52,399
## side of that they're consuming less so



4647
02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:53,200
## this is



4648
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:56,720
## you know without without the hard data



4649
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:59,040
## to really show and really dive into



4650
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,240
## everything that's happening we can't



4651
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:02,160
## just make a general statement that we're



4652
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:02,960
## losing



4653
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:05,040
## you know we need to actually look at



4654
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:06,080
## which countries are



4655
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:08,319
## having an impact and which aren't and



4656
02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:09,359
## why and



4657
02:34:09,359 --> 02:34:12,399
## dig deep into each situation right



4658
02:34:12,399 --> 02:34:14,800
## um and i agree with everything you said



4659
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:16,000
## also about um



4660
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,760
## you know getting the message right and



4661
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:19,840
## it's reassuring to know that



4662
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:21,760
## the more people are starting to be more



4663
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,600
## unapologetic i think the word would be



4664
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:26,960
## about defending the animals yeah yeah



4665
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:29,600
## and i also want to say that we don't



4666
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:31,520
## have definitive numbers either way on



4667
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:31,920
## this



4668
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:35,760
## on the amount of animals being oppressed



4669
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:38,640
## so i am skeptical of whatever data



4670
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:39,040
## people



4671
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:41,680
## are using to make these assumptions or



4672
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:42,880
## to make these



4673
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:45,520
## declarations about where things are in



4674
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,200
## terms of the numbers



4675
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:51,040
## so i i question that because i remember



4676
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:54,960
## when bite size vegan did a video



4677
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:58,160
## and she was trying to in that video give



4678
02:34:58,160 --> 02:34:59,040
## people



4679
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:02,240
## the kill count and even she concluded in
