3895
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:03,679
## said they will test again if they feel



3896
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:04,480
## that they



3897
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:06,560
## they say need to but let's be honest we



3898
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:08,159
## don't need that burger right



3899
02:10:08,159 --> 02:10:11,119
## um so they say they would do it again



3900
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:12,400
## and some people are saying because of



3901
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:13,119
## that the av



3902
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:14,560
## is not abolitionist and that's why they



3903
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:16,480
## don't want to work with av anymore



3904
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:18,639
## how do you what do you think of that



3905
02:10:18,639 --> 02:10:20,159
## well i just think that



3906
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:23,599
## to be consistent um



3907
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:25,840
## exactly what you said if we are



3908
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:28,480
## consuming products that at one time



3909
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,880
## in the past they were tested or an



3910
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,480
## ingredient was tested



3911
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:36,000
## we also use many products that um



3912
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,719
## again were either tested or they are



3913
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:41,280
## produced by a company that is not vegan



3914
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:44,079
## and you know like we can just keep going



3915
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:46,000
## down this rabbit hole but



3916
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,159
## ultimately to be consistent with the



3917
02:10:48,159 --> 02:10:49,360
## values that we have



3918
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,760
## i think it's okay to say that if you're



3919
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:53,679
## vegan and you eat the impossible burger



3920
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:55,199
## you're not suddenly not vegan that's



3921
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:56,480
## literally what i was saying i wasn't



3922
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:58,159
## promoting it necessarily but i was



3923
02:10:58,159 --> 02:10:58,960
## saying



3924
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:02,079
## um the impossible burger is as vegan



3925
02:11:02,079 --> 02:11:04,719
## as the beyond burger because one of the



3926
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:06,400
## things that i don't think i mentioned in



3927
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:07,280
## that video



3928
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:08,639
## and i think it's something that i



3929
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:10,880
## actually learned after doing that video



3930
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:11,679
## was that



3931
02:11:11,679 --> 02:11:13,840
## when they were working on the beyond



3932
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:14,800
## burger



3933
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:17,360
## they were buying burgers made of cow



3934
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:17,840
## flesh



3935
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:20,320
## and they were testing them or they were



3936
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:21,199
## maybe



3937
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:23,920
## just having a tasting session or



3938
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:25,679
## whatever to get the texture or the



3939
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:27,360
## flavors right so



3940
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,880
## i don't see any difference between the



3941
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:32,480
## two um in one scenario cows are being



3942
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,079
## murdered for the burgers and in the



3943
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:36,239
## other scenario mice are being murdered



3944
02:11:36,239 --> 02:11:38,079
## because they're being tested on so



3945
02:11:38,079 --> 02:11:40,880
## i just see them exactly the same they're



3946
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:42,320
## just different animals that are being



3947
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:43,920
## used in the process but



3948
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:46,079
## i just think to be consistent you either



3949
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:47,119
## have to say



3950
02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:49,280
## i don't use anything that was ever



3951
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:50,239
## tested or



3952
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:53,199
## is ever coming from a company that uses



3953
02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:55,360
## animals or uses animal testing



3954
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:57,119
## or you're just going to have to accept



3955
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,840
## that we do live in a non-vegan world and



3956
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,760
## as much as possible yes sure you can



3957
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:02,880
## avoid it but



3958
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:05,280
## i just don't see the difference between



3959
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,000
## like i said that



3960
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,520
## product and other products that we're



3961
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:10,000
## using um like to beyond virgo which



3962
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,400
## nobody has ever taken an issue with i



3963
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,639
## haven't seen it



3964
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:17,760
## and if i can just add to this argument



3965
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:20,400
## that we as an organization have made



3966
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:21,280
## essentially



3967
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:25,760
## regarding this topic uh



3968
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:28,560
## the only arguments i've ever heard from



3969
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,599
## those who are



3970
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:32,639
## trying to damn us



3971
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:35,440
## by uh saying that we're not like we're



3972
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,360
## not we're not abolitionists because we



3973
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:39,119
## hold this position



3974
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:40,560
## the only argument i see coming from



3975
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,239
## these people



3976
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:46,079
## is an argument for how impossible foods



3977
02:12:46,079 --> 02:12:48,239
## as a company is not vegan



3978
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:51,119
## to which we totally agree with the



3979
02:12:51,119 --> 02:12:53,360
## company is not vegan



3980
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:57,360
## the product itself however is vegan



3981
02:12:57,360 --> 02:12:59,520
## and that's why sales made the



3982
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,560
## distinction



3983
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:03,040
## between this and any other company that



3984
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:05,199
## sells a vegan product



3985
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:07,280
## a non-vegan company selling a vegan



3986
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:09,599
## product has always



3987
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:13,119
## been a product that vegans



3988
02:13:13,119 --> 02:13:14,960
## consume and are still considered to be



3989
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:16,880
## vegan when they consume it



3990
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:19,920
## uh and we don't you know when you said



3991
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:21,119
## we don't we don't need the impossible



3992
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:22,639
## burger that the same could be said for



3993
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:24,320
## every other product



3994
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:27,520
## that exists on the shelf so where do you



3995
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:28,960
## draw the line



3996
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:31,760
## and how do we make veganism practical



3997
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,040
## for people



3998
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,199
## by saying you can only support vegan



3999
02:13:35,199 --> 02:13:36,400
## companies



4000
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:37,840
## if you're only supporting vegan



4001
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,920
## companies in this



4002
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:42,960
## modern world we live in i don't think



4003
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,239
## veganism is possible



4004
02:13:44,239 --> 02:13:45,920
## that's it's actually i think an



4005
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:47,679
## irresponsible message



4006
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:50,960
## if we care about animal liberation



4007
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:53,920
## yeah so there's two points i'd like to



4008
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:55,440
## push on a little bit further with this



4009
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:56,079
## um



4010
02:13:56,079 --> 02:13:58,800
## one of them being that what do you think



4011
02:13:58,800 --> 02:13:59,520
## about



4012
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,199
## this is this these are this is internal



4013
02:14:01,199 --> 02:14:03,040
## okay i'm with you and i think that i



4014
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:04,239
## just want to put this point away



4015
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:04,960
## actually



4016
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,880
## that this will not in my opinion what we



4017
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,400
## are discussing here is the message we



4018
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,520
## put out to the public



4019
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:11,360
## because i don't believe that that's it's



4020
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:12,719
## it's going to be in any way



4021
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:14,800
## uh beneficial for us to slam the



4022
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:15,840
## impossible burger



4023
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,760
## to the non-vegan public right that



4024
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:19,440
## doesn't make any sense um



4025
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:22,239
## whatever they tested it on animals yeah



4026
02:14:22,239 --> 02:14:23,360
## it's [ __ ]



4027
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:26,239
## but um it's making tracks with



4028
02:14:26,239 --> 02:14:28,320
## non-vegans and it's it's



4029
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:30,079
## i don't know it's it's i feel like it's



4030
02:14:30,079 --> 02:14:31,440
## more of an internal thing that



4031
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:33,679
## that we discuss in this like as part of



4032
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:35,119
## the animal rights movement



4033
02:14:35,119 --> 02:14:36,960
## should this be an accepted thing like



4034
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:38,560
## into the movement or into veganism



4035
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:39,840
## should this burger be accepted should



4036
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,040
## these products be accepted i feel like



4037
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:42,719
## that's what we're discussing more than



4038
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:45,920
## a public statement um and that being



4039
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:46,639
## said



4040
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:48,079
## so a company like i mean that's where i



4041
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:49,360
## stand on it anyway that's why i don't



4042
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:49,679
## really



4043
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:51,040
## i don't want to get into like should we



4044
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:52,560
## talk about it you know pushing it to the



4045
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:54,159
## public or not i don't really think



4046
02:14:54,159 --> 02:14:56,800
## advertising vegan consumerism is i don't



4047
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,000
## really agree with that anyway i'm not



4048
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,679
## posting about subways vegan option or



4049
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:02,639
## mcdonald's vegan options
