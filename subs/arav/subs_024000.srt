4844
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:02,399
## the time



4845
02:40:02,399 --> 02:40:05,600
## really yeah



4846
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:07,359
## that's that's me as well you know that's



4847
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:09,280
## kind of i faced that personally



4848
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:11,920
## uh we do have a question though now from



4849
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:12,319
## um



4850
02:40:12,319 --> 02:40:13,600
## i'm not even going to try and pronounce



4851
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:14,880
## your name i'm sorry i should oh should



4852
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:15,359
## not it's



4853
02:40:15,359 --> 02:40:18,240
## disrespectful mr jackal let's say um do



4854
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:19,600
## you think donating money to animal



4855
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,520
## sanctuaries is worth the money



4856
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:22,880
## oftentimes the same people who say



4857
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:24,240
## outreach doesn't work advocate for



4858
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:25,760
## donating to sanctuaries or



4859
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:28,960
## fundraise themselves well



4860
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:30,800
## of course it's worth the money i think



4861
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:33,040
## we need we need people to donate to



4862
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:35,359
## animal sanctuaries and also donate to



4863
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:37,279
## organizations like av



4864
02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:38,720
## so that we can keep doing what we're



4865
02:40:38,720 --> 02:40:41,120
## doing i think it's all needed so



4866
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:43,760
## once we have these animals who are being



4867
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:46,240
## rescued obviously they're gonna need



4868
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:48,880
## a home so that's where the animal center



4869
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:49,840
## is coming and



4870
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:51,520
## they can't just operate without the



4871
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:53,279
## money so yeah



4872
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:54,880
## i think that's obvious that it's worth



4873
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:57,120
## the money



4874
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:59,040
## yeah i think maybe they're also alluding



4875
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:00,640
## to the idea that a lot of



4876
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:02,800
## these same individuals will say don't



4877
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:03,840
## donate to



4878
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:07,279
## ed or james or av or or whatever



4879
02:41:07,279 --> 02:41:08,720
## donate to a sanctuary because it's



4880
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:10,479
## better and you kind of



4881
02:41:10,479 --> 02:41:12,240
## give the impression that it's one or the



4882
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:13,600
## other you know that there's



4883
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:15,760
## people that that's it you can only



4884
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:16,640
## choose one



4885
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:18,000
## and you know one should get all the



4886
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:19,680
## money um



4887
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:22,880
## which which is nonsense obviously



4888
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:26,000
## yeah um



4889
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,319
## all right this is from michael paul and



4890
02:41:28,319 --> 02:41:29,200
## assal



4891
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:30,800
## you're still young do you think we'll be



4892
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:32,479
## living in a majority vegan world in your



4893
02:41:32,479 --> 02:41:34,960
## lifetime



4894
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:39,680
## i want to say yes so badly i just really



4895
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:40,399
## don't know



4896
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:43,359
## doesn't feel like in the next 50 years



4897
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:46,880
## or so we're going to achieve that



4898
02:41:47,279 --> 02:41:51,040
## to be realistic standing



4899
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:54,319
## sure i think uh for my side of this i



4900
02:41:54,319 --> 02:41:55,120
## think i'm



4901
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:57,920
## i agree but i also see it as positive



4902
02:41:57,920 --> 02:41:58,640
## that we



4903
02:41:58,640 --> 02:42:01,200
## i feel like we lay the foundations for



4904
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:02,080
## the future



4905
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:04,880
## generations that will achieve this so



4906
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:06,399
## although we won't see it



4907
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:08,160
## be realistic we're not going to see it



4908
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:09,840
## but we can do a lot of good work



4909
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:13,520
## to help the future people to see it



4910
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:15,359
## yeah it's like two-pack said you know we



4911
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:16,560
## may not be the ones



4912
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:19,600
## to see that but we will be the ones to



4913
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:21,200
## spark the minds of



4914
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:23,600
## those who will create that world and if



4915
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:26,479
## we don't create it ourselves but



4916
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:29,760
## um i think it's more important to just



4917
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:30,640
## be focused



4918
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:34,319
## on spending our lifetime



4919
02:42:34,319 --> 02:42:36,160
## on fighting for a vegan world rather



4920
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:37,840
## than



4921
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:41,200
## being attached to it coming to fruition



4922
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:43,520
## in our lifetime not that this question



4923
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:44,479
## suggests that



4924
02:42:44,479 --> 02:42:45,920
## it's just wondering whether we think it



4925
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:47,600
## will happen or not



4926
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:49,520
## i guess i just stopped thinking about it



4927
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:51,520
## and caring i guess i just i'm focused on



4928
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:51,920
## what



4929
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:55,200
## i can do day to day and



4930
02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:58,319
## uh in our lifetime that's all that we



4931
02:42:58,319 --> 02:43:00,000
## can focus on



4932
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:03,680
## cool agreed um



4933
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:06,240
## a super question this is a super chat by



4934
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:07,279
## the way if anyone was wondering what



4935
02:43:07,279 --> 02:43:08,800
## that looks like it looks like this so



4936
02:43:08,800 --> 02:43:09,600
## you can put a



4937
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:11,680
## price on it and it means that will uh



4938
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:12,960
## you'll pay for it it means you'll get



4939
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:14,479
## your question answered so

## creation of av um this rumor has been



4973

## around for a long time as far as i know



4974
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:33,520
## i think i've seen you deal with it once

## respond to this is it true that another



4979
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:41,920
## activist from melbourne created the idea



4980
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:44,240

02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:56,880
## this is this as well this is the second



4987
02:44:56,880 --> 02:45:01,840
## half of that question
