1054
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
## your ideas




1055
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,960
## won't always be accepted by the current




1056
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,000
## i don't know manager




1057
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,240
## leader organizer of that group and if




1058
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,839
## you don't like it then that's absolutely




1059
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,599
## fine you either continue volunteering or




1060
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,160
## you




1061
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
## create your own thing and do it your way




1062
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,240
## it's basically is that am i is that what




1063
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,119
## you're saying basically




1064
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,359
## what yeah because like of course we




1065
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,599
## always welcome feedback but welcoming




1066
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,880
## feedback doesn't mean we're going to




1067
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,400
## take it on board




1068
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,119
## we're going to discuss it between us too




1069
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,079
## and then




1070
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,640
## the team that we have and then we might




1071
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,880
## take it on board or we may not




1072
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,599
## but to expect that every single feedback




1073
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,520
## is just going to be accepted and we're




1074
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,400
## going to implement




1075
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,040
## that idea whatever it might be i think




1076
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,520
## that's




1077
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,280
## very unrealistic yeah it will be very




1078
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,520
## chaotic so yes if somebody doesn't like




1079
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,880
## the fact that




1080
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,079
## you know their feedback wasn't accepted




1081
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,520
## then i think if they feel like




1082
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,200
## they're not aligned with the




1083
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,880
## organization then they should just do




1084
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,480
## their own thing i mean that just makes




1085
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,240
## sense to me it's just very common




1086
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,440
## yeah and you know i think you clarified




1087
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,359
## but just to make sure




1088
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,520
## just to make sure that no one is




1089
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,680
## confused by what we're saying here




1090
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,960
## we're not saying you know if you if you




1091
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
## have any input




1092
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,920
## you know you have any feedback you have




1093
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,000
## any criticism




1094
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,680
## as a represent as a representative of ab




1095
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,040
## whether you're an organizer volunteer




1096
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,040
## we're not saying that we're just going




1097
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,599
## to say [ __ ] you and go do your own thing




1098
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,480
## that's not how we operate we and like to




1099
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,560
## think that we've only ever




1100
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,599
## enacted ideas that have come




1101
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,240
## from either my brain or a cell's brain




1102
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,599
## is insane




1103
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,720
## we've always taken on feedback from




1104
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,839
## others




1105
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,320
## and taken it into account and i think




1106
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,160
## the last thing i want people to consider




1107
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,599
## here is




1108
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,640
## where would ab be today




1109
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,880
## like really think about where a baby




1110
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
## would be today if we




1111
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,359
## weren't operating the way that we are if




1112
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,359
## we ran a system where we had like




1113
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,560
## a board of um




1114
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,079
## you know board of directors where we




1115
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,240
## only had a vote




1116
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,040
## into what was and we only had two votes




1117
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,720
## of many




1118
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,079
## into what was being decided on




1119
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,240
## i mean i think it's i i think it's clear




1120
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,839
## that av wouldn't be clear




1121
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,000
## about the message and i don't think that




1122
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,480
## we would be




1123
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,680
## where we are today that leads on to




1124
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,119
## another point quite nicely actually




1125
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,640
## because i think what i feel like you're




1126
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,480
## hinting at here is that that




1127
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,040
## if you didn't maintain control you feel




1128
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,280
## that av would go down the same road as




1129
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,119
## pretty much every other ar organization




1130
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,280
## has gone down where they are bringing in




1131
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,000
## uh human issues um on human rights




1132
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,480
## issues




1133
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
## and basically kind of i guess




1134
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,920
## i guess if i if you could put in a way




1135
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,760
## that they're moving with the times




1136
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
## rather than staying true to what they




1137
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
## started for if that makes sense um and




1138
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,520
## some people would say that that is a




1139
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
## positive thing




1140
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,839
## you know to move with the times because




1141
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,599
## let's be honest the you know the the




1142
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,480
## times




1143
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,040
## are very much changing and you know a




1144
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,480
## lot of human rights issues have




1145
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,400
## very much been thrown to the front and




1146
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,240
## that's not necessarily a bad thing




1147
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,880
## um but you could argue that ar




1148
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,000
## organizations




1149
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
## also taking those fights on board is




1150
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,119
## some




1151
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,720
## some and i guess you would argue that is




1152
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,040
## a bad thing and that brings me to




1153
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,079
## another question that has been asked or




1154
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,520
## let's say a topic that has been brought




1155
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:37,920
## up




1156
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,960
## uh the topic of anti-intersectionality




1157
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,359
## and uh and you know what this means with




1158
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,720
## with av what intersect or not




1159
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,000
## intersectionality i don't think that's




1160
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,680
## even the correct thing to talk




1161
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,200
## to to say because i don't




1162
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,760
## intersectionality itself i'm sure we all




1163
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,079
## if there's anybody in this in this chat




1164
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,119
## or even you guys




1165
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,440
## that say disagrees with the concept of




1166
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,119
## it i would just say you're disagreeing




1167
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,240
## with facts right




1168
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,560
## if the fact is that intersexuality as it




1169
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,000
## was originally coined




1170
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,480
## it's it's factual it's like you know




1171
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,160
## someone who's female and black will




1172
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,359
## experience the world differently to




1173
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,119
## someone who's male and white or someone




1174
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,280
## who's female and white or someone who's




1175
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,680
## you know transgender and black or




1176
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,480
## transgender and




1177
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,520
## everyone experiences the world




1178
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,880
## differently and has different challenges




1179
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,240
## right that's what it means




1180
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
## that's literally what it means not what




1181
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,440
## vegans have made it that's




1182
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,839
## [ __ ] so we all will agree that




1183
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,200
## that's what it means i'm sure




1184
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,359
## and i you know i guess no one really




1185
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,800
## would would say it would argue against




1186
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,880
## that it's just logic it's just factual




1187
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,440
## but let's say uh the they call




1188
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,040
## themselves consistent anti-oppression




1189
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,079
## crowd let's say




1190
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,960
## and and this is something that you have




1191
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,760
## get




1192
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,119
## like more than once you've stood out




1193
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,880
## stood up against and you've said said




1194
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,839
## some things about




1195
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,240
## you know the animals first um approach




1196
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,079
## non-humans first approach




1197
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,960
## um and this has been widely criticized




1198
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,640
## and a lot of people have even




1199
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,680
## you know people make videos about this




1200
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,040
## they are constantly attacking




1201
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,760
## you guys for this they are people um
