1473
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:01,599
## my



1474
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,680
## how i answer that question is is that



1475
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,359
## way it's not speciesism because i'm not



1476
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,960
## doing it because of the species



1477
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,720
## i'm doing it because of the severity of



1478
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,000
## the situation



1479
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,319
## we've never even said the term animals



1480
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,839
## first human second



1481
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,000
## like that's come from other people we've



1482
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,200
## never said that before



1483
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,280
## right right what we've never said is



1484
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,960
## animals deserve to have a cause



1485
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,160
## dedicated



1486
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,680
## solely to them and so av



1487
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,400
## will be that



1488
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,800
## sure i actually i i don't know if i've



1489
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,240
## ever heard you say that i don't think i



1490
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,440
## don't think i have and something but



1491
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:33,839
## some



1492
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,760
## people have messaged that so if anyone's



1493
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,040
## watching right now and you



1494
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,800
## you feel like you have some evidence of



1495
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,640
## that then you're more than welcome to



1496
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,079
## send it and we'll discuss it and



1497
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,400
## you know but i i yeah it's it's



1498
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,599
## something that does keep coming up and



1499
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,200
## that goes for other things by the way



1500
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,760
## if you're watching now and we we go



1501
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,559
## through something and



1502
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,200
## and you know but we discuss our this



1503
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,640
## i've never said that or this has not



1504
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,200
## happened



1505
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,440
## and you think it has you just send me a



1506
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,960
## message with what you think has happened



1507
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,480
## or within with evidence of it and we'll



1508
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,240
## we'll talk about it right now we're not



1509
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,240
## we're not here to hide away from things



1510
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,160
## and you know paul and us how you agreed



1511
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,079
## to come on here to actually



1512
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,760
## directly face some of these things you



1513
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,680
## know so if anyone does have something



1514
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,280
## that they feel should be directly faced



1515
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,520
## just send it me on instagram or



1516
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,040
## messenger or email um or you know tag



1517
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,480
## tag me in the comments and tell me



1518
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,760
## you're gonna send it on messenger or



1519
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,040
## whatever and i'll and i'll pick it up



1520
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,280
## and



1521
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,319
## we'll bring it up on the screen and



1522
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,839
## we'll talk about it like we're not we're



1523
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,280
## not hiding anything but



1524
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,880
## i've got a sneaky suspicion that that's



1525
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,559
## not gonna happen because



1526
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,000
## most of the stuff we're talking about is



1527
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,839
## just rumor and you know



1528
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,040
## it's i don't think there's a lot of



1529
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,880
## evidence behind it to be honest



1530
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,079
## um yeah but um let's



1531
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,280
## let's i think we're still on



1532
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,599
## intersectionality and



1533
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,119
## i think i feel like we maybe want to



1534
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,319
## delve into that just a little bit



1535
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,119
## further



1536
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,400
## um i guess what i guess your guys stance



1537
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,760
## on it i mean somebody asked the question



1538
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,720
## here saying



1539
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,040
## what are you doing to make your activism



1540
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,800
## intersectional somebody asked that



1541
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,520
## uh of you guys and and i was thinking



1542
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,200
## like how can i really ask that because i



1543
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,240
## don't i don't i don't know if it's



1544
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,680
## something that you actually are trying



1545
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,400
## to do



1546
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,880
## um i don't i know that there was a i



1547
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,480
## know there was a change of direction



1548
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,680
## recently as to i don't know not be so



1549
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,119
## i don't know what the word is to be more



1550
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,800
## sensitive i think with your own words



1551
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,319
## um because maybe in the past there was a



1552
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,160
## little bit of insensitivity but i guess



1553
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,640
## yeah



1554
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,760
## what would you say to someone who's



1555
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,920
## asking you that how what are you doing



1556
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,119
## to make your activism more



1557
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,880
## intersectional



1558
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,680
## we're not trying to do that like you



1559
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,079
## said



1560
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,440
## but that's not the goal there's no need



1561
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,119
## for us to



1562
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,280
## try to do that and let's just cut the



1563
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,160
## [ __ ] here



1564
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,319
## people who say this are not actually



1565
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,599
## asking us



1566
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,040
## to adopt anti-oppression values within



1567
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,640
## our organization because



1568
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,440
## we already have those what they're



1569
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,640
## asking us to do



1570
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,480
## is become activists for human related



1571
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,040
## issues



1572
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,960
## and we are dedicated to non-human



1573
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,240
## animals



1574
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,680
## sorry not sorry so you draw



1575
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,599
## you draw a line i guess uh between



1576
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,839
## not contributing to other oppressions



1577
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,160
## are they drawing a line sorry between



1578
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,839
## not contributing to other oppressions



1579
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,000
## and being active for other oppressions



1580
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,680
## and they feel that because



1581
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,000
## you are on the not contributing side of



1582
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,760
## the line that therefore means that you



1583
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,079
## are



1584
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,920
## wrong and that you should be actually



1585
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
## active for those oppressions too correct



1586
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,200
## they want us to be on the streets



1587
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,640
## showing footage of



1588
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,559
## what's happening in the blm movement or



1589
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,839
## with regards to homelessness or feminism



1590
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,680
## or i guess whatever the mainstream issue



1591
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,800
## is of the times



1592
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,960
## but going back to what you were saying



1593
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,480
## earlier about



1594
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,440
## like the definition of intersectionality



1595
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,160
## it actually



1596
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,359
## doesn't apply here because



1597
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,720
## sure you can be an animal rights



1598
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,480
## activist you can also be



1599
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,319
## a human rights activist in what that



1600
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,000
## whatever area you want to



1601
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,240
## work in but um what's the relationship



1602
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,119
## between



1603
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,480
## like any of those things that you



1604
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,319
## mentioned and animals



1605
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,960
## suffering you know what i mean there is



1606
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,079
## no relationship so



1607
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,440
## i i don't think it actually makes sense



1608
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,559
## to ask that of us



1609
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,240
## so how are we gonna make it work with



1610
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,079
## that even if that was something we were



1611
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,160
## looking at doing how are you gonna



1612
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,920
## connect homelessness to animal suffering



1613
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
## in the median egg industry



1614
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,280
## we get asked to speak up about various



1615
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,000
## issues



1616
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,280
## and it is really only about what is



1617
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,280
## popular at that time what is being



1618
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,280
## spoken about at that time



1619
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,839
## and it's not about these issues that



1620
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:42,640
## cause



1621
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,760
## a vast number of deaths around the world



1622
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,799
## for example in



1623
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,640
## the middle east that never gets spoken



1624
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,319
## about that we're aware of because we



1625
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,760
## have heritage in the middle east



1626
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,559
## we know about these things these people



1627
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,559
## for example who were outraged about what
