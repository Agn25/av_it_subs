## people would get would get upset about



5003
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:39,920
## that actually no



5004
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:43,680
## um i don't know okay well



5005
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:45,279
## that's what this is i'm trying to use



5006
02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:46,800
## the correct term but uh



5007
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:49,840
## trying not to crucify me guys uh yeah so

## don't really know



5010
02:45:54,319 --> 02:45:56,479
## what this is but we know about the



5011
02:45:56,479 --> 02:45:58,560
## original accusation that came



5012
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:02,560
## from individuals plural in melbourne



5013
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:05,600
## and uh and



5014
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:07,439
## that's all documented actually it came



5015
02:46:07,439 --> 02:46:09,120
## out with the whole liberation is



5016
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:11,120
## inclusive truth of cube



5017
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:14,399
## uh video that was made about us



5018
02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:18,640
## um they jumped on that bandwagon



5019
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:20,560
## and contribute contributed to the



5020
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:22,399
## document that was



5021
02:46:22,399 --> 02:46:24,960
## linked in the caption of that video



5022
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:27,279
## wherever it's shared you'll see the link



5023
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:29,120
## and wherever you see that link you'll



5024
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:31,200
## see the document and in that document



5025
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:32,960
## you'll see these individuals who came



5026
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:34,319
## out initially



5027
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:37,200
## and made this accusation that they



5028
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:39,120
## created av with us



5029
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:42,080
## and that we stole it from them now this



5030
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:43,200
## story



5031
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:46,319
## that we're being asked of here is



5032
02:46:46,319 --> 02:46:50,399
## is is is claiming that it was uh



5033
02:46:50,399 --> 02:46:53,840
## we were volunteering



5034
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:05,120
## according to this person just to close



5035
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:06,640
## this off they say it's they're saying



5036
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:08,000
## this is a direct claim



5037
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,319
## from the person who claims to have had



5038
02:47:10,319 --> 02:47:12,319
## this conversation with you



5039
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:15,359
## so it's it's uh it seems like it's um i



5040
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:16,640
## don't know if you don't if you don't



5041
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:17,760
## know this and it's



5042
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:20,640
## it's you know it seems made up i guess



5043
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:20,960
## yeah



5044
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:25,120
## if it's like when someone becomes famous



5045
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:26,720
## many people start coming out and



5046
02:47:26,720 --> 02:47:28,399
## claiming that that person is their



5047
02:47:28,399 --> 02:47:29,920
## cousin



5048
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:33,279
## right uh and yet that's what



5049
02:47:33,279 --> 02:47:34,800
## it's kind of like the same thing here



5050
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:36,399
## people are claiming that they created a



5051
02:47:36,399 --> 02:47:38,160
## v but there's no basis for any of this



5052
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:38,800
## we've heard



5053
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:40,800
## i've heard a couple of different uh



5054
02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:42,479
## people trying to claim this



5055
02:47:42,479 --> 02:47:45,680
## over the years but um



5056
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:49,600
## these people aren't doing much



5057
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:52,319
## yeah so that's what they claim to to



5058
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:53,279
## activism is



5059
02:47:53,279 --> 02:47:56,319
## but i uh i i feel for these people if



5060
02:47:56,319 --> 02:47:58,000
## they really want to tear



5061
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
## like they want to try to steal that from



5062
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,520
## us



5063
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:03,279
## all the hard work we've put in and all



5064
02:48:03,279 --> 02:48:05,359
## the



5065
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:07,359
## commitment we've given to this



5066
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:08,720
## organization if they want to try to



5067
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:09,920
## steal that from us



5068
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:12,000
## it says something about what they're



5069
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:13,600
## suffering from internally



5070
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:15,760
## like i'm sorry that they thought they



5071
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:17,040
## need to take from us



5072
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:19,920
## in that scenario because it means that



5073
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:21,040
## they must be hurting



5074
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:23,200
## somewhere somewhere else and not feeling



5075
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:24,640
## adequate for themselves



5076
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:26,479
## and i i really mean it that i feel bad



5077
02:48:26,479 --> 02:48:29,040
## for these people



5078
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:32,080
## fair enough um funny question okay it's



5079
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:32,800
## kind of funny



5080
02:48:32,800 --> 02:48:34,160
## um are you friends with joey carver



5081
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:36,000
## strong again nope



5082
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:39,040
## no yeah i thought that might be the case



5083
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:40,880
## i genuinely like i didn't say this in my



5084
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:42,560
## video actually but um when i made the



5085
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:44,560
## video about this but i on a personal



5086
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:45,840
## note you don't have to respond to this



5087
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:46,160
## but



5088
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:48,720
## i do hope i do hold some hope that that



5089
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:50,000
## can be



5090
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:51,840
## fixed between you guys that you can come



5091
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:53,120
## to some kind of i don't know



5092
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:54,399
## i hope that you can be friends again



5093
02:48:54,399 --> 02:48:55,680
## because it was you know you had a good



5094
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:57,200
## thing going



5095
02:48:57,200 --> 02:48:58,640
## you were supporting each other it was



5096
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:00,399
## good it's a shame to see it all go to



5097
02:49:00,399 --> 02:49:01,040
## [ __ ]



5098
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:04,160
## but he did what he did and what happened



5099
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:06,640
## happened you know



5100
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:09,359
## yeah look i forgive him for making a



5101
02:49:09,359 --> 02:49:11,040
## stupid mistake he's human



5102
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:14,160
## humans make stupid mistakes but for as



5103
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:15,680
## long as he



5104
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:18,479
## won't acknowledge his mistake there's no



5105
02:49:18,479 --> 02:49:18,960
## room for



5106
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:20,240
## i don't i can't be friends with people



5107
02:49:20,240 --> 02:49:22,080
## who lack accountability it's just not a



5108
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:22,640
## part of



5109
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:25,040
## my quality that i hold myself to and



5110
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:28,319
## what i expect from friends



5111
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:31,200
## yeah that's understandable it's



5112
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:32,880
## understandable but i can't yeah as many



5113
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:34,479
## most people i can't help hoping that it



5114
02:49:34,479 --> 02:49:35,600
## can be worked out



5115
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:37,600
## but it's this is kind of in his court



5116
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:40,479
## isn't it the balls in his court on this



5117
02:49:40,479 --> 02:49:42,560
## um someone's asking a question that it's



5118
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,080
## it's an obvious question



5119
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:45,600
## uh but i'm gonna put it up anyway



5120
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:48,000
## because it's a yeah you can easily just



5121
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,279
## answer it um



5122
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:50,560
## it's on the transgender topic again



5123
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:52,560
## they're saying you said everyone should



5124
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:54,000
## be respected we all agreed everyone



5125
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,240
## should be respected does this mean that



5126
02:49:56,240 --> 02:49:57,760
## if someone hates transgender people



5127
02:49:57,760 --> 02:49:59,200
## should they be respected



5128
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:01,439
## this is what i mean this is what i mean
