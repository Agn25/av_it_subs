## away from their pain or their suffering



1338
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,200
## that's how i see it i mean how



1339
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,440
## more audacious could you possibly be



1340
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,240
## as a human being any human being



1341
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,359
## to say you're more oppressed than a



1342
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,839
## group of beings



1343

1344
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,119
## by the trillion with a t every



1345
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,760
## year when was the last genocide of one



1346
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
## billion with a b



1347
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,960
## humans oh wait



1348
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,079
## crickets a billion



1349
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,880
## i'm talking three trillion with a t



1350
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,960
## are subjected to this injustice every



1351
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,000
## single year



1352
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,920
## it's happening every second of every day



1353
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,520
## doesn't need to be explained to vegans



1354
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,839
## of course



1355
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,560
## but hello don't get mad at us for being



1356
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,440
## a medium of truth



1357
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,400
## yeah i think um just to add to that i



1358
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,480
## think this is this is a point that i



1359
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,560
## i agree on i mean i'm i guess i'm not



1360
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,000
## supposed to be sharing my personal views



1361
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,760
## here i am interviewing you but i have to



1362
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,200
## say i agree with you because



1363
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,599
## um i don't believe that it's down to



1364
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,119
## emotions at this point i believe it's



1365
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,079
## down to the facts



1366
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,960
## and it's objectively true it's it's it's



1367
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,640
## not something that can even be argued



1368
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,319
## against and anyone who's tried to argue



1369
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:28,800
## against



1370
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
## even with me the arguments it just falls



1371
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,079
## to pieces because



1372
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,240
## you can't possibly claim that any other



1373
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,079
## animal on the planet is abused



1374
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,400
## well any human animal on the planet is



1375
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,599
## abused or or



1376
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,160
## exploited or objectified more than a



1377
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,480
## non-human the non-humans don't even have



1378
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,720
## political rights or voices like it's



1379
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,560
## it's not even about how much they say



1380
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,079
## even if we forget how many of them are



1381
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,000
## abused in the severity the fact that



1382
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,319
## they



1383
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,119
## literally have no say at all in their



1384
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,400
## own lives



1385
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,200
## um like none none whatsoever no legal



1386
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,720
## almost no legal rights



1387
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,680
## you know um it's it's enough you know



1388
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,200
## it's enough to just even go from that



1389
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,720
## even if it wasn't three trillion



1390
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,880
## that alone is enough of a point you know



1391
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,240
## but at that and



1392
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,160
## the fact there's three trillion of them



1393
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,480
## being you know horrifically



1394
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,720
## murdered it's it's it's yeah it's a



1395
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,079
## crazy point to try to



1396
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,760
## to try to argue against that in my



1397
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,520
## opinion and i'm always surprised when



1398
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,559
## vegans try to argue against it it's i



1399
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,160
## mean nothing really surprises me anymore



1400
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,040
## actually



1401
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,280
## but but yeah it's slightly more



1402
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,160
## surprised



1403
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,440
## with that um i've got a question uh



1404
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,400
## do you think this is this came from a a



1405
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:36,880
## uh



1406
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,040
## instagramer i think uh do you think it's



1407
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,200
## speciesist to ignore human oppression



1408
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,359
## while fighting for non-human animals



1409
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,559
## that was that was a question that



1410
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,839
## somebody wanted to ask you guys



1411
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,920
## you know i know that people aren't



1412
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,119
## attuned to



1413
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,559
## nuance and context but



1414
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,800
## it is required for us to answer this



1415
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,920
## question



1416
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,960
## uh as a general statement yeah like



1417
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,599
## the way you ask that of course not like



1418
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:06,319
## yeah



1419
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,800
## sorry the question was is it is it



1420
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,160
## speciesist



1421
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,079
## do you think it yeah do you think it is



1422
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,839
## personally do you find it to be



1423
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,680
## is that is that an example of speciesism



1424
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,880
## basically yes



1425
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,280
## when i hear that question as a blanket



1426
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,520
## statement like that yes



1427
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,920
## because it sounds like otherwise



1428
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,760
## otherwise you're denying



1429
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,000
## that group of things like their



1430
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,680
## existence and their suffering and their



1431
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,559
## oppression



1432
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,000
## so yeah of course it is but yeah like we



1433
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,319
## need an example or an explanation of why



1434
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,839
## because



1435
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,800
## is that because again because av is 100



1436
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,720
## focused on non-human animals



1437
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,200
## or is this question directed at us



1438
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,960
## personally and people are wondering if



1439
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,200
## we do other forms of activism where we



1440
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,880
## care about other poison



1441
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,839
## forms of injustice every every day we



1442
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,760
## make a post on social media about



1443
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,880
## non-human animals



1444
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,839
## every day we set up cube of truth action



1445
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,520
## on the streets



1446
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,960
## those energies are spent on fighting for



1447
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,880
## non-human animals while



1448
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,079
## human injustices are occurring within



1449
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,319
## human human to human injustices are



1450
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,880
## occurring around the world



1451
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,520
## at that time so if at a general level



1452
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,680
## you want to say because of our answer



1453
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,119
## we're technically ignoring



1454
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,880
## all of these other injustices while



1455
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,440
## we're doing that well



1456
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,920
## there's no such there's no point of even



1457
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,720
## trying to



1458
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,920
## like there's no nuance at all



1459
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,359
## in the way that someone would think if



1460
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,839
## that's the conclusion they're trying



1461
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,559
## yeah yeah i think i would add to that



1462
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:44,880
## and



1463
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,720
## i don't think it's speciesism because



1464
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,920
## you're not uh



1465
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,839
## you're not not fighting for humans i'm



1466
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,839
## not i'm not not fighting for humans



1467
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,200
## because i think humans are somehow



1468
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,000
## inferior



1469
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,520
## i'm choosing to fight for non-humans



1470
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,280
## because i believe that well not i



1471
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,559
## believe they are



1472
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,280
## um in more need simple as that so that's
