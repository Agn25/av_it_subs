757
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,679
## like the major donations coming in




758
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,760
## um so the biggest




759
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
## part of it would obviously be the




760
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,159
## payments to the team members so




761
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
## including myself paul and um at




762
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,320
## some point we had just over 30 people




763
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
## working with av




764
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,559
## so you can imagine how much that would




765
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,679
## cost roughly




766
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,720
## and then now we've got i think




767
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,240
## i don't know actually how many people




768
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,559
## we've got like around 20 people working




769
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,440
## with us




770
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,279
## including us too so the the bulk of it




771
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,720
## is going towards payments so that those




772
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,200
## people




773
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,640
## can continue to work for av and then




774
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,840
## the second biggest um thing




775
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,480
## has always been the av fund which is




776
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,159
## something that we started




777
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,440
## um and we would dedicate a certain




778
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
## amount of money to go towards chapters




779
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,720
## that were




780
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,960
## um you know active chapters that needed




781
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,799
## some help getting their equipment so




782
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,720
## that was always like




783
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,080
## the second um biggest expense for us




784
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,159
## and then yeah the rest of it is just you




785
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,159
## know if if people look into




786
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,159
## what costs are involved in terms of you




787
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,559
## know all the admin stuff all the




788
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,559
## programs that you need the software's




789
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,320
## the subscriptions




790
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
## and then all the big campaigns that we




791
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,360
## were doing as well so




792
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,840
## okay and with the staff they were 30




793
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960
## were they all full-time




794
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,720
## 30 staff um no we had




795
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,760
## so we um




796
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,440
## we have people that work with us as




797
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,000
## contractors so av doesn't have like




798
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,480
## staff




799
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,520
## necessarily but um everyone's like an




800
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,159
## independent contractor that comes in and




801
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,520
## they can do




802
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,120
## um part-time or full-time and




803
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,440
## um i think i would say maybe it's




804
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,240
## half-half




805
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
## half of the people that work with us are




806
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
## full-time half are part-time




807
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,720
## um or just come in as volunteers even




808
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,520
## sometimes




809
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,039
## they they do some work casually yeah




810
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,960
## cool okay so i'm just trying to like put




811
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,320
## a number on it i think for




812
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,799
## anyone who maybe is not following um so




813
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,960
## like 30 staff if you had 30 staff that




814
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,440
## were




815
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,600
## only working let's say like not




816
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,799
## full-time hours they so they're working




817
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
## part-time hours right so let's imagine




818
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,320
## it's 30 staff working 20 hours a week so




819
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,799
## we'll go




820
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
## like we'll go low right we'll pitch low




821
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
## here 30 staff working




822
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,120
## 20 hours a week and let's imagine that




823
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,080
## the




824
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,600
## i'm going to work in yearly salaries




825
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
## here like base yearly salary in euros




826
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,399
## for example




827
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,000
## the absolute minimum you could earn a




828
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,440
## year to survive in a




829
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,799
## place like i don't know let's pick a




830
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,559
## cheap let's baseline everything low




831
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,000
## let's go low on everything the minimum




832
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,360
## you could earn in a year




833
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,880
## in somewhere like spain for example




834
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,240
## would be like because that's where i




835
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,960
## know




836
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,120
## it's like 16 000 euros a year it's the




837
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,799
## absolute minimum and that's really




838
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,159
## pushing it like it's really difficult




839
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,840
## and that would be a full-time salary




840
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,799
## so that's like that's half that 8 000 a




841
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,200
## year




842
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,880
## and let's imagine that's 30 staff that's




843
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,440
## 240 000 euros a year




844
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
## that's it that's pitching low that's if




845
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,039
## you have no full-time staff that's if




846
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,120
## all of your staff are only working like




847
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,440
## like half-time hours let's imagine right




848
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,799
## so just to put that into perspective for




849
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,080
## anyone who's wondering how much that




850
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,760
## would be so like it could it could be




851
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,240
## anywhere upwards from 240 000




852
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,000
## euros a year which would be like i don't




853
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,320
## know 300 000 us dollars maybe something




854
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,120
## like that




855
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,320
## so that is that is a huge chunk yeah and




856
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,240
## i think when i when i first watched a




857
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
## video and i heard that




858
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,960
## and i worked it out myself at that time




859
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,320
## and i was like yeah that's actually a




860
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,279
## chunk of money




861
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,200
## that i don't think many people




862
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,320
## understand right




863
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,480
## um it doesn't it doesn't sound like a




864
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
## lot but when you actually calculated it




865
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
## is quite a lot so




866
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
## um the next thing then you talked about




867
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,720
## the the av




868
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,200
## uh fund the for the for the chapters




869
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,279
## where does it come from then that that




870
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,360
## does this apparently this is a rumor




871
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,799
## okay there's no i don't have evidence of




872
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,080
## this and i'm sure there isn't evidence




873
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,559
## of this




874
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,559
## uh maybe there's one or two organizers




875
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,000
## who have caused this problem




876
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,760
## but where is it coming from that the




877
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,520
## chapters are not getting the funding




878
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,200
## where has that started do you know where




879
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,320
## that came from




880
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,000
## or do you know what's going what what is




881
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,919
## actually behind it like are they getting




882
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:06,960
## the funding




883
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,120
## i'm sorry to ask the question but it




884
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
## came it came up a lot again




885
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,159
## no i think it's the same thing as




886
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,360
## everything else like




887
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,240
## somebody just started this rumor that av




888
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,520
## keeps the money




889
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,240
## or specifically paul and style keep the




890
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,320
## money to themselves and they don't




891
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,559
## send any money to the chapters i think




892
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,600
## it's just




893
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,679
## again we don't even know where this came




894
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,039
## from but




895
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,279
## if people were really interested this is




896
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,080
## one thing that can be easily tracked




897
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,240
## we have a full list of everyone who ever




898
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,600
## received the fund




899
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,440
## how much they received it what they




900
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,640
## spent it on




901
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
## and um because everyone who receives the




902
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,080
## fund




903
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,600
## they were supposed to send us the




904
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,679
## invoices so it's like




905
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,880
## we have all the records and




906
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,240
## um i guess the only thing is that p




907
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,200
## we weren't um doing it in a way that




908
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,760
## just as




909
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
## as soon as you become an organizer you
