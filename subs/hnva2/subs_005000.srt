00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,320
## i don't well yeah i don't know how that works in 
## other countries or if it just creates a caption  



454
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:16,240
## in in english um yeah i'm not sure how that works 
## but anyways we have that three-hour video for at  



455
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,480
## least the english-speaking people of the world and 
## uh that's pretty cool so let's get back into this  



456
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,600
## is it's we give them a card anyway so they get 
## support they get whatever they need at the end  



457
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,640
## so don't focus on health another good question 
## is when you're tying in the benefit at the end  



458
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,640
## of that three-step process to ask the question 
## do you think it's possible to be against this  



459
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:48,880
## to be against what you're saying you're against 
## while also supporting it and it's a good question  



460
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,600
## to just tie in hypocrisy again and also to tie 
## in the fact that there is no way around this  



461
00:50:53,600 --> 00:51:00,720
## there's no alternative you're either an animal 
## abuser or you're not another thing i want to say  



462
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,480
## about this approach that i'm teaching you right 
## now is that this is way more satisfying to do  



463
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,000
## than all these other approaches that involve 
## pandering and compromising on the message  



464
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,680
## and focusing on being liked and all this stuff 
## this is way more satisfying i've noticed that  



465
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:23,520
## over the last four years there was a huge surge 
## in 2017 2018 for street outreach in our network  



466
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,280
## and then it sort of dropped and i feel like people 
## have lost interest in doing outreach they don't  



467
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,200
## really see the benefits and how successful 
## it is and they're not really convinced on how  



468
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,960
## effective it is anymore when you're doing this 
## approach you'll come to learn that all of your  



469
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,160
## interactions are successful even if the individual 
## doesn't say that they're going to go vegan  



470
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,400
## you've at least told them what they need to hear 
## which is probably the only time they're going to  



471
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,880
## hear it and when you have that perspective every 
## interaction is successful because again we're  



472
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,080
## mediums of truth we speak for the animals in the 
## same way that we would want to be spoken for if  



473
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,680
## we were in their position we have a rule that 
## we only talk to people who stop at the cube and  



474
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,320
## that's because we want to talk to people who are 
## open-minded and we also have an opening question  



475
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:16,400
## that we ask would you like to know why we're here 
## because we need a commitment from them so that  



476
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,040
## this is a two-way conversation so you shouldn't 
## be talking to people who are obviously unreachable  



477
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,480
## but at the end there they don't say they're going 
## vegan then there's no reason for you to think that  



478
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:34,960
## wasn't a successful interaction so many times 
## people don't even say anything affirmative to  



479
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,480
## the outreacher and they become vegan this happens 
## so often now we had someone at the melbourne  



480
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:47,200
## workshop who was sitting and learning who said 
## i don't think that the outreacher who got me to  



481
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:54,800
## go vegan at a cube a year ago in melbourne even 
## knows that i went vegan because i argued with the  



482
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,480
## outreacher and walked off that's another reason 
## why we've removed the tallies but i'll talk a  



483
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:08,400
## little bit about that at the end who here has not 
## heard about socratic questioning raise your hand



484
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,960
## alright fair few of you this has been 
## blown out of proportion a little bit too  



485
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:22,320
## socratic questioning is a tool and it's a very 
## good tool but it is only a tool it should be  



486
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,920
## used within your interaction wherever you see fit 
## wherever it's supposed to be used because asking  



487
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,720
## questions is always a good idea it's always a 
## good way of gathering information from the person  



488
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,600
## to see where they're at psychologically when it 
## comes to this but don't just use it throughout  



489
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,920
## the whole interaction don't just ask question 
## after question after question there's gonna be  



490
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:48,160
## many times during the interaction where they give 
## you the flaw to speak and lecturing them in that  



491
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:55,840
## moment is actually the right way to go the reason 
## why socratic questioning is there is because  



492
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,640
## um so when i say giving you the like they're not 
## necessarily giving you the flaw it's just a part  



493
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,040
## in the a moment in the interaction where they're 
## not saying anything and it would be completely  



494
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:12,400
## appropriate for you to say something and to 
## make a statement at that point because and i'm  



495
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,240
## gonna break this down a little bit later when 
## i do the slides because at that point when you  



496
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,920
## make a statement or a closed-ended question or 
## you don't even ask a question at all at that point  



497
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,680
## what you're doing is pushing the conversation 
## forward and that's necessary sometimes i'll break  



498
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,680
## this down a little bit more detail like i said 
## but i just wanted to add that commentary let's get  



499
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:39,040
## back to it because we we wanna they give you the 
## flaw to speak and lecturing them in that moment  



500
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:45,120
## is actually the right way to go the reason why 
## socratic questioning is there is because we want  



501
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:52,320
## to ask questions instead of make statements but it 
## doesn't mean that making statements is a bad idea



502
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,520
## so i know that after i teach you guys this 
## stuff it's just human nature that you will
