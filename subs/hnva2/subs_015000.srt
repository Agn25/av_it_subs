01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:08,160
## this for a while i learned this the hard way gary 
## told me told everyone and i didn't think it was  



1043
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:15,760
## necessarily true either at first but i've come 
## to learn this very much so humans what can i say  



1044
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:24,320
## it's terrible but one thing that gives me optimism 
## and hope is that there are plenty of us out there  



1045
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:29,280
## who vibrate on this frequency and that's all 
## we need to do to continue moving forward is  



1046
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:36,240
## us supporting us so when i read your comments 
## supporting av supporting me and asal and the  



1047
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:40,960
## whole av team we appreciate it so much 
## because it means that we are working  



1048
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,680
## together we do have unity between those who 
## vibrate on this frequency and that's important  



1049
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:53,360
## where can you get the new outreach cards from 
## your organizer if there's no organizer in  



1050
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:59,600
## your city go over to our website and go to the 
## join section and apply to become an organizer  



1051
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:05,840
## so that you can launch a cube of truth a chapter 
## in your city where cuba truth events operate



1052
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,000
## lots of questions coming through



1053
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,960
## how do i respond to people that 
## say they can't go vegan because of  



1054
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:25,200
## medical advice point them to 
## all of the medical advice that  



1055
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:32,240
## that says otherwise we have empirical data 
## that shows that it's perfectly adequate for  



1056
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:39,200
## all human beings to be on a plant-based diet 
## point them to the evidence there's only one  



1057
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:48,400
## source of scientific data there's only 
## one database okay so michael greger is  



1058
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:54,400
## a great person to look into because he breaks down 
## the data so nutritionfacts.com but the thing i  



1059
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:59,200
## just want nutritionfacts.org is the website there 
## but i just want to say that this person saying  



1060
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:10,000
## this most likely woody is using this as an excuse 
## to not go vegan if they're truly wanting to end  



1061
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,160
## the abuse that they cause to animals the needless 
## suffering or in their case they think it's  



1062
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:19,280
## required but if they really want to end it then 
## they'll look into it and they'll do their very  



1063
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:25,280
## damnedest to make it happen to to end it 
## and so if you are talking to someone who's  



1064
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:30,320
## truly trying to end it then just give them that 
## information that should be enough but usually  



1065
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:43,840
## it comes back to accountability in those cases 
## usually people are just using that as an excuse



1066
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,280
## is it cruel to raise kids 
## non-vegan it's cruel to the animals  



1067
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,400
## yeah and it is cruel to humans on some 
## level but it's not even comparable to  



1068
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:01,040
## what we do to the animals so i'm not even 
## going to say it's cruel to the humans um so



1069
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:09,120
## what was the other part of that 
## question um saying this as a mother  



1070
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:15,440
## it's cruel to the animals and you're robbing 
## children and you're robbing children over there  



1071
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,880
## you're making them confused and you're robbing 
## them off i mean every vegan will say they wish  



1072
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:24,800
## they were vegan since birth so you're robbing 
## them of that opportunity to do the right thing  



1073
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:30,720
## when kids are just doing what their parents 
## tell them to do so when non-vegans say don't  



1074
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:36,080
## force this on your children they're forcing 
## non-veganism on their children parenting is  



1075
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:43,040
## forcing that's what parenting is they do what 
## their parents tell them to do up until they're 18.  



1076
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:50,320
## so it's if you're gonna have to choose a diet for 
## them why wouldn't you choose the one that doesn't  



1077
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:56,960
## involve bloodshed abuse torture suffering when 
## it's needless that's my answer to that question



1078
01:54:04,640 --> 01:54:07,840
## much love jeanette appreciate your comment



1079
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:10,640
## um



1080
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,640
## how do you convince religious people or anyone 
## who is used to seeing animal abuse since young  



1081
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:23,920
## to feel something for the animals that's two 
## different questions there religious people



1082
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:28,240
## it's no different this whole approach is no  



1083
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:31,200
## different if people say i 
## believe god said it's okay



1084
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:39,280
## classic gary quote if god says this 
## is okay then what does the devil do



1085
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:46,160
## just you're not going to get through 
## to most religious people you just  



1086
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,080
## need to ask them these really tough questions  



1087
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:52,720
## and treat them no different to anyone else 
## with the approach that we're giving you



1088
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,320
## okay um and that second question 
## i think i've already answered
