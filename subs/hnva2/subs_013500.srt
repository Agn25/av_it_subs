01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:07,600
## use environmental facts when it keeps changing 
## on us when it comes to these things studies can  



900
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:15,840
## come back to us that may prove us wrong on the 
## environment tip in fact i've seen it proven that  



901
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:21,520
## you can be environmentally way more 
## better off as a non-vegan than a vegan  



902
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:28,720
## in many circumstances if you live in a rural area 
## you're a minimalist and you fish from your kayak  



903
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,400
## you're way more environmentally friendly than 
## a person who lives in new york procreates  



904
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:43,120
## eats processed foods so environmentally this is 
## not a surefire argument this really isn't and i  



905
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:48,160
## just want to say from the health point of view can 
## also be justified you can eat a piece of cheese or  



906
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:54,400
## you can eat a salmon once a week and justify that 
## from a health perspective because you just bounce  



907
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:59,520
## back very easily from a health point of view you 
## can feel better pretty quickly so there's no point  



908
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:07,360
## of even arguing the health and the environment for 
## those reasons next question even if that were true  



909
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:14,000
## reply like because i found that to be quite 
## good and when you say even if that were true  



910
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,040
## how do you justify this do you ever use that at 
## all i do i've been using that recently people  



911
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:24,400
## say i think there's bigger issues in the world 
## right human issues are more important well even  



912
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,400
## if there are bigger issues in the world which 
## we actually know that this is the biggest issue  



913
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,720
## with the health and environment the only reason 
## why we're talking about it is because animal  



914
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:40,640
## rights is such an issue that it's impacted our 
## environment it's become that big of an issue that  



915
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:48,640
## it impacts our environment and it impacts human 
## health to the extent that it does but we can give  



916
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,440
## them that still and say even if there are bigger 
## issues what justifies you doing this to them



917
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:02,560
## any other questions yes i've found on the internet 
## so you put something up about veganism a lot of  



918
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,800
## people just put like you know means to take the 
## piss out of the veganism people sort of just go  



919
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,520
## straight to that and they won't listen to 
## you after that like so they take the piss  



920
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:16,160
## out of what you're trying to do and then you just 
## can't get through to them at all because they're  



921
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:21,760
## so fixated on taking the piss out of us how 
## would you get through take the piss out of them



922
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,240
## roast them in return they're the ones that 
## are supposed to be roasted yeah but if they're  



923
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:34,000
## just trolling they're not reachable but my simple 
## response would be to roast them back but sometimes  



924
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,880
## it's just like people are more drawn to a picture 
## or something because the bulk amount of people  



925
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:44,400
## can just you know gang up on you like that and 
## it makes you feel like you know you should just  



926
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:49,440
## stop talking like it's sort of hard it feels 
## like you're trapped in that position where  



927
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:55,600
## you know like there's no actual response that's 
## worth and then it just makes you think oh you know  



928
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:00,400
## what i'm doing am i actually doing the right thing 
## is it worth me spending my time doing this you're  



929
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:04,960
## definitely doing the right thing when you speak 
## up for the animals it's always a good idea it's  



930
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:10,080
## always worth doing i think your question is is 
## it effective to be doing that is that what you're  



931
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:15,200
## asking yeah so i don't know like with regards to 
## the comments that coming in on your facebook or  



932
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:19,520
## instagram i don't know if those individuals are 
## going to go vegan but it may be more about who's  



933
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:24,880
## reading it you know what i'm saying the imprint 
## that you leave on those individuals it's important  



934
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:30,560
## that you only focus on what you're saying and how 
## you advocate for the animals so that if anybody  



935
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:35,680
## ever does stumble across the comment thread that 
## they read the right thing they hear what they're  



936
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:40,400
## supposed to hear from you know what i'm trying to 
## get at yeah yeah and that's the best you can do  



937
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,800
## whether you should be doing this with those 
## individuals i don't know because you'd have  



938
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,240
## to give me more specific examples about what 
## they're saying and how they're saying it  



939
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:52,080
## but if they're dropping memes about 
## eating meat and how tasty bacon is  



940
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:56,160
## i've actually found that roasting 
## those people can be pretty effective  



941
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,560
## don't waste too much energy on it you may want 
## to block them after a certain point once you've  



942
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,760
## made your point for people to read so you may 
## want to manage it that way on social media  



943
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:13,840
## but as long as you say the correct thing you're 
## in the right space yes um paul um i just wrote  



944
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,520
## down this thing that i was going to say when you 
## were talking about the blood on your hand on their  



945
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:23,840
## hands so i found it actually harder to speak to 
## people that i know personally that love animals  



946
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:28,160
## um also they love animals they actually i've 
## lost four people that i've known for a long  



947
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:33,600
## time because they they seem to think that my 
## message is hateful so people who have tried  



948
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:39,120
## to break down the barriers um around animals 
## in agriculture they reject any notion of even



949
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,800
## so when my compassion for the animals involved 
## into more what you would call aggression and  



950
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:55,040
## like passionate speaking and ask why they can 
## ignore those animals quite um and can be hateful  



951
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:02,000
## how do we get people to abandon a lifetime 
## of adoption and views around farm animals
