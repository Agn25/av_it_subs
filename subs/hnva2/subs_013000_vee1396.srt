848
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,560
## you guys are probably thinking [ __ ] i 
## don't know if i could say that to people but  



849
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,160
## i'm telling you this is the most satisfying 
## thing that you can say to somebody  



850
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:19,840
## because it's effective because that is the most 
## effective thing that you can say to somebody  



851
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:25,600
## and again this has been applied i mean we've got 
## a very keen student in the back here hudson do you  



852
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,440
## want to tell people what kind of reactions you've 
## had or if you've had any negative interactions  



853
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:35,840
## yes at first i was really worried about it about 
## this whole approach and paul was like no we gotta  



854
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:41,120
## try it you gotta try it and then i went up to 
## people who were twice my size hold up hold up  



855
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:45,360
## start from the start when you didn't want to do 
## this you thought that this was too aggressive  



856
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:50,240
## yeah i thought it was way too aggressive i got 
## brainwashed by the vegan movement and thought  



857
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:57,600
## that it's the wrong approach and anyway i recently 
## tried out this approach being direct and what i  



858
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:03,520
## found is people have so much more respect for me 
## because i don't come across as some politician  



859
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:10,560
## trying to sell them something and i found it's 
## worked so much better because people recognize  



860
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,880
## that we're not calling them hypocrites because 
## we don't like them we're doing it because we  



861
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:20,240
## don't like animal abuse and we're against the 
## torture of animals that's a big point unless  



862
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:25,680
## you have an ego issue this shouldn't be seen 
## as malicious by the person you're speaking to  



863
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:29,120
## unless you have an ego issue and you just want 
## to be right all the time and you're trying to own  



864
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:34,880
## people and that's the only reason why you're doing 
## activism then people may respond negatively to you  



865
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,560
## but what they pick up on is that your heart is in 
## the right place when you say this stuff you're not  



866
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,840
## saying this stuff for any other reason you 
## only know this to be true if you apply it  



867
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:50,640
## no matter what i say no matter what hudson just 
## said you need to apply this put aside everything  



868
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:55,920
## you've learned about outreach about everything 
## you've learned about animal rights activism and  



869
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:01,680
## just apply this not just today but for the 
## following cubes that occur after today keep  



870
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:08,640
## doing this and see what results you have because 
## again this is the reason why you went vegan  



871
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:13,040
## because you don't want to be a hypocrite you don't 
## want to be an animal abuser and someone called you  



872
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:19,600
## out on your hypocrisy if it wasn't someone else 
## it was yourself that made this distinction oh



873
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:30,320
## i know it's crazy but apparently i need to 
## make this distinction for people when i say  



874
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:38,720
## holding non-vegans accountable i don't mean 
## forcing people to go vegan you can't hold  



875
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:44,160
## people accountable in the true sense of the word 
## because people have to hold themselves accountable  



876
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:52,000
## in the end it has to be a choice that comes from 
## them when i say holding people accountable it's  



877
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:59,600
## to the greatest extent that we can 
## possibly do so through verbal interaction  



878
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:05,520
## okay i didn't think i needed to clarify that but 
## i've been getting comments and dms from people  



879
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:11,200
## saying you can't force anyone to be vegan 
## this holding non-vegans accountable approach  



880
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:15,040
## is off base because people can 
## only hold themselves accountable  



881
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:21,840
## well this approach puts people in the best 
## position to hold themselves accountable  



882
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:30,720
## and that's the truth does this make sense to 
## everybody so thanks for the uh comments about  



883
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:36,160
## the audio there i'm doing my best here with the 
## technical end of things but let's just go back  



884
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:44,560
## doing this and see what results you have because 
## again this is the reason why you went vegan  



885
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:48,800
## because you don't want to be a hypocrite you don't 
## want to be an animal abuser and someone called  



886
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:54,080
## you out on your hypocrisy if it wasn't someone 
## else it was yourself that made this distinction



887
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,880
## does this make sense to 
## everybody are you feeling this



888
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:06,240
## all right now i'm going to take questions your 
## hand went up lightning fast i got to respect that  



889
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:13,120
## quickly what's your opinion on joaquin 
## phoenix's oscar speech on the long reaching  



890
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:17,840
## effectiveness of that i loved it but it's 
## i wouldn't have said exactly what he said  



891
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:22,880
## but i love the fact that he used his platform 
## to talk about what happens in the dairy industry  



892
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:30,240
## i didn't like how he conflated it with love and 
## compassion so much because i don't think you need  



893
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,520
## to love animals to not stab them to death you 
## don't need to love black people to know that  



894
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:38,960
## they deserve their rights you don't need to love 
## any being to know that they deserve their rights  



895
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,840
## it's not the perfect message but i still think 
## it was great that he did that i also want to  



896
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:50,640
## point out that joaquin phoenix said that meat and 
## dairy is the third leading cause of environmental  



897
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:55,600
## destruction or climate crisis but didn't we 
## hear in conspiracy that it was the leading cause  



898
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:01,440
## so why the [ __ ] are we even doing this why are 
## we even promoting environmentalism and trying to
