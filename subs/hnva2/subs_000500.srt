## a question what's your opinion on wild animal  



61
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,800
## suffering it's a topic i recently discovered 
## i don't know if you've heard of it or not

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,680
## might have seen it in might have seen it from 
## humane hancock okay so i did respond to this  



63
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,800
## uh on my instagram so i forget what i 
## said exactly but i said something like  



64
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,760
## let's just focus i mean my answer to this question 
## is pretty straightforward let's just focus on the  



65
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,200
## human inflicted suffering on animals that we 
## are currently i mean it's the biggest issue  



66
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,800
## that we have to be accountable for so we need 
## to look in the mirror before we start trying  



67
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,240
## to intervene further in the animal kingdom 
## can we just stop murdering animals first can  



68
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
## we stop enslaving torturing and murdering them 
## that's what i would like to address this whole  



69
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,200
## thing and i think this is what i said in my 
## instagram post this whole thing is such an  



70
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:34,640
## odd discussion to me it's so strange and uh 
## it reminds me of how off-base it is for human  



71
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:43,760
## beings to explore and discover the universe and 
## space to the extent that humans do and yet we  



72
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,240
## still have 80 percent of the ocean 80 percent 
## completely undiscovered unobserved unexamined



73
00:09:53,280 --> 00:10:00,640
## you know this is just very typical of humans 
## i think that we don't address we don't look
