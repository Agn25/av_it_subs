207
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,320
## they were talking about animals every 
## single time even people like joe rogan  



208
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,840
## who's a [ __ ] avid hunter and loves to justify 
## not being vegan at every opportunity he gets  



209
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,040
## even he said he supported the wildlife in 
## australia and he was referring to the koalas  



210
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:28,960
## and the other animals people around the world have 
## only shown empathy or sympathy towards the animals  



211
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,160
## that were suffering in the wildfires right that 
## just goes to show that this is very obvious in  



212
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:40,400
## people's minds and that's why i'm saying this is 
## a lot more obvious than we think it is it really  



213
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,920
## is people already care about animal rights 
## and the reason i know that is because nobody  



214
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,200
## unless they're a psychopath would be comfortable 
## with the label of being an animal abuser  



215
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,560
## and that's what non-vegans are they're abusing 
## animals the only reason why they feel comfortable  



216
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,600
## is because the guilt is shared by everybody we've 
## broken out of that now we can see straight now  



217
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,400
## but it doesn't mean that it's not completely 
## obvious still for everybody else we've just  



218
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,520
## taken action on this none of these excuses are 
## ever going to trump you they should never have  



219
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,920
## you feeling flustered they should never have you 
## feeling like you don't know the answer because  



220
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:29,200
## the answer is always very simple and it's the fact 
## that they can't justify abusing animals needlessly  



221
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,360
## end of story whenever in doubt 
## just compare to any other



222
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,160
## but it should injustice like a 
## delicacy and something that we eat  



223
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,400
## maybe once a week instead 
## of i don't think that the  



224
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:51,840
## the rate that we use it is natural we're 
## at the extreme end of this lifestyle now



225
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,680
## would you say that with any 
## other injustice like sexism  



226
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,880
## child abuse no but i'm saying would 
## you take that position would you say  



227
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,800
## that it would be too extreme to avoid at 
## all that we should still do it sometimes



228
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:17,280
## yeah that was good that was a good rebuttal we're 
## not vegan but we're vegetarian delivered chicken  



229
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:23,680
## yeah so we're fish chicken so would you take the 
## same position with any other injustice let's say  



230
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:31,440
## we're talking about sexism or racism would you 
## have the same view on that where are we going here  



231
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:38,560
## so let's say we're talking about racism yeah 
## would you be like i'm against racism i don't  



232
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,200
## want to be a racist but then maybe 
## like on sundays i make an exception



233
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,800
## to be racist yeah so this is a form of 
## discrimination against another species  



234
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,160
## while you're still having a little bit of egg or 
## chicken whatever i'm not sure what you're having  



235
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,240
## you're still really supporting animal cruelty 
## and more exploitation we will do it slowly i  



236
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,360
## understand it might seem like a big jump would 
## you take that on any other issue for example  



237
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,120
## if somebody said i'm going to slowly stop 
## beating my child i'm going to slowly become  



238
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,920
## a non-racist no you wouldn't be uh that's we 
## got to do it right do you think that we should  



239
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,440
## contribute to this last or do you think that we 
## should say hey we should just stop hurting animals  



240
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:36,320
## stop stop right people will talk a good game about 
## reducing or making excuses for why they won't go  



241
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,080
## vegan just compare to any other injustice in that 
## moment we are an animal rights organization we've  



242
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,240
## never deemed ourselves to be an environmentalist 
## group a group of environmentalists trying to  



243
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,320
## change the world for the betterment of the 
## environment we've never claimed to be a  



244
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,320
## nutritionist organization a group of nutritionists 
## trying to change the world for the betterment of  



245
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,520
## human health we've only ever claimed to be an 
## animal rights organization but there's this myth  



246
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,640
## that exists in the vegan movement that when you 
## promote health and environment these things will  



247
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,120
## get people more interested in animal rights and 
## that's the reason why we've been talking about  



248
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,960
## these things is to try to get them hooked if 
## someone doesn't seemingly care about animals  



249
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,600
## well i guess i'll talk to them about health 
## because they have heart disease i guess i'll  



250
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,040
## talk to them about how they can reverse their 
## heart disease by eating a plant-based diet if they  



251
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:29,360
## don't seemingly care about the animals we think 
## we'll talk to them about the environment this  



252
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,520
## is destroying the rainforest this is destroying 
## our climate crisis the idea that this will lead  



253
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,120
## someone to animal rights and caring about animal 
## rights is a complete myth animal rights is obvious  



254
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,800
## nobody in their right mind would be comfortable 
## with the label of being an animal abuser so  



255
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,840
## it's not a matter of people not caring 
## about animal rights it's a matter of you  



256
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,160
## not promoting animal rights correctly it may 
## seem like a tough pill to swallow to hear that
