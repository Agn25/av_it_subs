747
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:11,760
## animal abuse animal cruelty yeah absolutely most 
## people say yes absolutely now if they say no  



748
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:19,440
## they're either drunk or trolling and either 
## way you shouldn't be having a conversation  



749
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,160
## with those people they're not reachable 
## again this is so obviously wrong i mean  



750
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,840
## you're seeing animals being hacked apart on 
## the screens how could anybody say this is okay  



751
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,320
## so usually they say that then the next step would 
## be okay what do you think you can do about it as  



752
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,120
## an individual so we've gone from the first step 
## of the process within the three-step process of  



753
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:43,440
## emotional conviction really quickly moving to 
## the second step which is accountability what  



754
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:48,880
## do you think you can do about it and again most 
## of the time i actually get i think i could stop  



755
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,560
## eating them i could become vegan so what do 
## you think you can do about it as individuals  



756
01:20:54,560 --> 01:21:01,040
## stop become vegan yes we can vegan it's very 
## simple isn't it yeah that's why i'm saying  



757
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:08,240
## this is so [ __ ] obvious to people it's not that 
## complex it's really not it's very obvious so the  



758
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,680
## interaction so then you say what do you think 
## you can do about this as an individual usually  



759
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:16,880
## they say well i can stop being vegan but if they 
## say something that a lot of the times they'll  



760
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,520
## actually try to distract and say well you can 
## protest the government protest these industries  



761
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,600
## again you deal with the objection bring it 
## back to accountability that's all you're doing  



762
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:32,240
## deal with the objection anchor it back to 
## accountability once you have the concede  



763
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,600
## after dealing with all of those back and 
## forth back and forth once you have them  



764
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:40,400
## concede then you bring in the benefits do you 
## know what the number one benefit is to be vegan  



765
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:47,120
## usually their ears perk up when you say 
## benefit and they look at you like what is it  



766
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,400
## i want to know and that's when you say 
## well obviously the benefit for them is  



767
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:56,160
## they're no longer tortured and abused 
## for you you're no longer the reason  



768
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:01,920
## that this happens to them but the benefit for you 
## is that you no longer have to be an animal abuser



769
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,680
## right so a new update again and i'm gonna 
## break this down in the slides that i do later  



770
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:18,080
## but the update here is to 
## say for the first time um  



771
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:26,000
## you will have the opportunity to stop being a 
## hypocrite instead of saying you will no longer  



772
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,880
## be a hypocrite and i'm saying this because 
## many vegans are straight-up hypocrites  



773
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:39,040
## but when you become vegan it is the first 
## time in human life you can stop you have the  



774
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:46,080
## opportunity to stop being a hypocrite uh because 
## you address the biggest hypocrisy i think humans  



775
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:54,240
## are engaging in so i just want to clarify 
## that it doesn't automatically remove you  



776
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:59,600
## from hypocrisy when you become vegan but it does 
## give you an opportunity to truly end hypocrisy  



777
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:06,160
## and you no longer have to be hypocrite and abused 
## for you you're no longer the reason that this  



778
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:12,160
## happens to them but the benefit for you is that 
## you no longer have to be an animal abuser and you  



779
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:16,800
## no longer have to be a hypocrite because you say 
## that you're against animal abuse do you guys know  



780
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:24,480
## what the number one benefit is of not supporting 
## what's on the screen from being vegan any guesses



781
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,440
## so the number one benefit obviously 
## for the animals once you're vegan  



782
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:37,440
## then they're no longer tortured and abused 
## because of you so they're relieved of that  



783
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:42,400
## and then the best benefit for you guys is that 
## because in the beginning of the conversation  



784
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,920
## you stated that you're against animal abuse 
## you're horrified by what's on the screens  



785
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,800
## when you're vegan for the first time 
## then you no longer have to be a hypocrite



786
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:03,040
## never thought of it like that do you know the 
## number one benefit of going vegan the number  



787
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:09,280
## one benefit obviously for the animals once you're 
## vegan then they're no longer tortured because of  



788
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:15,040
## you so they're relieved of that and then the best 
## benefit for you is that because you said you're  



789
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:20,560
## against animal abuse when you're vegan for the 
## first time you no longer have to be a hypocrite



790
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,680
## and do you know the number one benefit when 
## you stop supporting animals and be vegan the  



791
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:33,280
## number one benefit of that you're not part of a 
## crazy-ass society that's actually really close  



792
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:38,480
## it would first be for the animals would no 
## longer be abused by you but as an individual  



793
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:43,440
## this is really important on an individual 
## level since you've told me in this conversation  



794
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,840
## that you are against animal abuse and you're 
## clearly disturbed of what you see on the screen  



795
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,080
## when you become vegan for the first time 
## you no longer have to be a hypocrite  



796
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,160
## do you know the number one benefit of being vegan 
## like the number one benefit any guesses like
