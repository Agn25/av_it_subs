1537
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:09,599
## explanation but they should still be quick to 
## respond to your response should always anchor  



1538
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:21,840
## back to individual accountability this can't be 
## more simple this is so simple again 30 seconds



1539
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:49,840
## all right moving on



1540
02:50:52,240 --> 02:50:57,760
## bring it back to the individual if they try to 
## create excuses that try to remove accountability  



1541
02:50:57,760 --> 02:51:06,640
## for example pointing to rural communities lions 
## low income families etc don't get lost in lengthy  



1542
02:51:06,640 --> 02:51:12,880
## explanations bring it back to the individual 
## by placing themselves in the victims position  



1543
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:18,480
## and asking how that excuse justifies their 
## personal contribution to animal abuse



1544
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:23,840
## i don't know if contribution is the right word  



1545
02:51:23,840 --> 02:51:26,640
## i might update that but you 
## guys know what this is saying



1546
02:51:31,359 --> 02:51:37,679
## uh yeah 30 seconds i'm gonna 
## shave five seconds off that so 25



1547
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:45,840
## seconds



1548
02:51:52,319 --> 02:51:59,840
## objections are good they can 
## be good yes they can be good



1549
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:06,640
## all right moving on next slide



1550
02:52:11,439 --> 02:52:18,319
## um tying the benefit tying the benefit only 
## once they concede by saying if they're against  



1551
02:52:18,319 --> 02:52:22,799
## animal abuse then it's not possible to be 
## against animal abuse while supporting it  



1552
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:29,200
## the number one benefit of going vegan for the 
## animals the benefit is that they no longer have  



1553
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:36,479
## to be tortured and abused because of you for 
## you if you say you are against animal abuse  



1554
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:41,839
## and what you see on the screens then when you're 
## vegan you no longer have to be a hypocrite  



1555
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:49,679
## and so we're going to update this part like i said 
## to say when you're vegan you have the opportunity  



1556
02:52:50,720 --> 02:53:00,080
## for the first time in your life to not be 
## a hypocrite so that's the update there when  



1557
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:05,040
## you're vegan you now have the opportunity 
## to no longer be a hypocrite this drives home  



1558
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:09,840
## the accountability and makes them understand 
## the consequence of their actions 30 seconds



1559
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:33,600
## wow this has gone on for ages i saw it like five 
## hours ago govi well jen you know i'm trying to  



1560
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:40,880
## make sure that this workshop is as thorough 
## as possible but we're almost about to wrap up



1561
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:50,880
## do people only care about being 
## hypocrites yeah because it affects  



1562
02:53:51,439 --> 02:53:54,719
## people care about themselves 
## and the image of themselves and  



1563
02:53:56,560 --> 02:54:00,560
## if you want to hit people and and mess up 
## their ego about themselves that's how you  



1564
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:04,480
## do it you you call them out on things like 
## this and this is unfortunately how people  



1565
02:54:05,359 --> 02:54:10,559
## work i mean i wish that it was just as 
## easy as saying guys we have 50 less than  



1566
02:54:10,560 --> 02:54:15,440
## 50 years left on this planet animal abuse is 
## the biggest pressing issue of our time we have  



1567
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:20,719
## no right to be abusing animals please stop 
## if that was it was just as easy as that



1568
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:26,960
## i would i would that's what i would be telling 
## you to do in this outreach workshop but it's not  



1569
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:29,121
## moving on



1570
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:36,720
## 26 all right close the conversation 
## always end outreach conversations  



1571
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:44,480
## by asking what the individual will personally 
## do to take action ask them open and ask  



1572
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:50,319
## the open-ended question after our conversation 
## what are you going to do about this injustice  



1573
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:57,439
## after a long conversation they may still 
## say that they'll only reduce or do nothing  



1574
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:03,279
## if they can if you can sense that the 
## interaction will keep going in circles
