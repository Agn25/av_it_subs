552
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,680
## very simple issue seriously animal abuse is 
## wrong and there's no justification for it  



553
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,520
## we don't need statistics to prove that to people 
## necessarily if people want to talk about this to  



554
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:19,760
## you and they bring up statistics and they want 
## to debate statistics make sure that you're not  



555
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,960
## feeding into the distraction too much i 
## want to talk about vegetarianism real quick  



556
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,440
## i think vegetarianism is a cancer 
## to the animal rights movement  



557
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,920
## and we think that for some reason in this 
## movement we think that vegetarians are closer  



558
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:45,040
## to this message they're our allies again we would 
## never do this with i just wanna i just wanna take  



559
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:51,520
## a moment to call myself out this is the holding 
## non-vegans accountable 2.0 workshop but i'm going  



560
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,040
## to take a sweet moment to hold myself accountable 
## because i just said in this movement we think  



561
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:03,680
## that vegetarians are the same whatever i said i 
## don't think that anymore in fact i've probably  



562
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,240
## been the most vocal about this in the animal 
## rights movement but yeah i was just talking  



563
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:14,720
## about how we need to be accurate with our words so 
## i just want to pull myself up there and say that  



564
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:23,840
## i no longer talk like this about vegeta i never 
## really did ever so yeah any other injustice and  



565
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,840
## you and they bring up statistics animal abuse 
## is wrong and there's no justification for it  



566
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,080
## make sure that you're not feeding into the 
## distraction too much i want to talk about  



567
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:43,600
## vegetarianism real quick i think vegetarianism 
## is a cancer to the animal rights movement and  



568
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:49,600
## we think that for some reason in this movement we 
## think that vegetarians are closer to this message  



569
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:57,600
## they're our allies again we would never do this 
## with any other injustice and vegetarian is no  



570
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:06,880
## different to paleo i mean vegetarians will stop 
## eating meat then that's no different to what the  



571
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:13,840
## paleo crew are doing because they don't eat dairy 
## and it's been argued that the dairy industry could  



572
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:19,840
## be the cruelest industry in the world we should 
## really be calling the paleo crew our allies



573
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,920
## not vegetarians but do you see how insane 
## that sounds me even saying that we would call  



574
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:35,360
## the paleo guys our allies just because meat is 
## obviously cruel to animals it doesn't mean dairy  



575
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:41,040
## isn't and eggs isn't and you all know that because 
## you're vegan and you already know this information  



576
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:48,080
## but when we even slightly give in to this 
## idea that vegetarians are on our side then  



577
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:54,320
## we perpetuate this myth even further we are the 
## ones who are spreading the wrong message here  



578
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,880
## so when someone says don't worry i'm 
## vegetarian you don't need to talk to me  



579
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,720
## your response should be you're actually our 
## target market and in fact you have more of a  



580
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,000
## responsibility to go harder on those individuals 
## because they already think they're doing enough  



581
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,280
## they feel entitled and how dare you tell them 
## they're doing any different is the attitude  



582
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,600
## they usually give you i appreciate all that 
## you're doing just once you know that i'm a  



583
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:24,960
## vegetarian that drinks almond milk okay that's 
## good local farm interesting i'm just saying like  



584
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,200
## you might want to just focus your food versus 
## somewhere else because i i totally am already  



585
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:33,520
## on board i got that so was animal cruelty 
## one of the reasons why you became vegetarian  



586
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:39,760
## since i was 19 i'm 45 okay that's about 27 years 
## of vegetarian one of the footage that we chose  



587
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,200
## here is also from local like free range like egg 
## farms let me ask you a question because you say  



588
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,880
## that you usually get your eggs from like local 
## like free range farms where did they get their  



589
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:59,040
## hands from like for example her father's chickens 
## that run around his yard so like they are i don't  



590
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:04,240
## know where he gets attention because um what sex 
## is important in the egg industry males are females  



591
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:11,840
## obviously the females so when people get hence 
## they get them from a breeder in hatcheries even  



592
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:17,120
## like for people that just want to get like 
## a egg laying hence males and females are  



593
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,880
## born a different color if you're born female 
## you're thrown to the left if you're a male  



594
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:27,200
## you're thrown to the right where do you think 
## the males go i get it directly into a blender



595
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,040
## so i'm doing everything i can to 
## minimize my impact but i'm not good  



596
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:40,160
## would you consider animal cruelty to be an 
## injustice yes yeah would you take that same  



597
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:44,160
## stance with any other injustice because you do 
## recognize that there is cruelty and eggs right  



598
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:52,800
## sure so i found with the majority of vegetarians 
## actually they're harder to get through they're not  



599
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:58,400
## our allies they're not closest to this message 
## they're pompous sure there's vegetarians out  



600
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,520
## there who didn't know better and i've met many 
## of those too they just didn't know better once
