601
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:09,120
## you tell them they go vegan on the spot 
## that's the dream circumstance but i'm  



602
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,000
## saying most people are not like this if they're 
## vegetarian imagine if all vegetarians were vegan  



603
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,360
## the percentage of vegetarians is always way 
## larger than the percentage of vegans when  



604
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:24,480
## they do those statistics imagine if all the 
## vegetarians were outreached effectively and  



605
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:29,600
## they went vegan we would have way more vegans 
## on our side also when people at the end of your  



606
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:34,880
## outreach will say i'm gonna try to do better 
## i'll try i'm gonna try to go vegan please  



607
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:42,400
## do not use the word try and do not let people 
## use the word try would you try to be a non-racist  



608
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,720
## would you try not to be a child 
## abuser or would you just [ __ ] stop  



609
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:53,280
## once you realize that it's wrong again 
## don't let them off the hook let them  



610
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,640
## know that there is a moral imperative here 
## when someone says i'm gonna try what i say  



611
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:05,600
## in order to get them to rid themselves of this try 
## nonsense is to compare it to any other injustice  



612
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:10,320
## like i just compared it to child abuse and 
## racism etc would you say that you would try  



613
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,840
## or would you just stop and that usually 
## corrects that for people very quickly



614
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:30,080
## um i'm going to get into this a little bit more 
## later but i want to add this piece in here and say  



615
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,800
## that we have had another update to this section  



616
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:40,000
## we're constantly seeking to improve here 
## guys we're constantly making software updates  



617
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,840
## and one of them is this one here when we 
## compare to other injustices we've actually found  



618
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:54,000
## see okay so my analysis on this is that 
## human beings only truly care about themselves



619
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:04,560
## that's it so when we say child abuse racism 
## sexism feminism whatever it is we're relying  



620
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:10,480
## upon how much they care about those issues and 
## if they're not an activist when it comes to those  



621
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:16,480
## issues we shouldn't expect that they care 
## a great deal about those issues should we  



622
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:24,880
## so we've found that the most effective thing to do 
## in all situations is in fact hold them accountable  



623
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:30,160
## to themselves so in other words instead of 
## comparing it to an injustice that involves  



624
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:38,320
## other groups of humans how about you just ask them 
## about themselves how would you feel if someone  



625
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:47,280
## was torturing you enslaving you and was going to 
## murder you and the excuse your oppressors used was  



626
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,680
## i'm trying to do less of it i'm only going to cut 
## they say they're only going to cut your leg off  



627
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,760
## uh you're probably gonna die from a doe 
## so is that better than not killing i mean  



628
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:07,200
## you know it's essentially putting them in the 
## victim's position and saying what if someone was  



629
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,560
## to enslave torture and murder you less but 
## never ever liberate you from your oppression  



630
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,400
## how would you feel would you want to 
## be liberated if you were the victim  



631
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:23,840
## or would you want these nonsense baby 
## steps that don't really go anywhere  



632
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,920
## so when you're comparing to other groups of humans 
## it might be most effective for you to in fact  



633
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,120
## according to our latest update and my 
## analysis on this is that if you just  



634
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:42,880
## rely on the fact that human beings truly only care 
## about themselves uh more than more they at least  



635
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,640
## care more about themselves than than anything 
## else any other group of humans and i'm speaking  



636
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:55,360
## generally for most people here this is why i'm 
## trying to get deep into what is the most effective  



637
01:08:55,360 --> 01:09:00,160
## because there is no perfect approach for every 
## single individual on the planet that doesn't exist  



638
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:07,120
## what i can only teach you is most effective 
## for most people and i'm going to continue  



639
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,480
## to expand that and improve on that as 
## much as possible let's get back into it



640
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:22,400
## would you say that you would try or would you just 
## stop and that usually corrects that for people  



641
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:29,200
## very quickly i want to try to be better 
## there's no trying when it comes to justice  



642
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:36,240
## you can't try to be non-racist you're either 
## non-racist or you're a racist and i say that  



643
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:40,800
## comparison because you understand injustice 
## in that context but justice is justice  



644
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:47,840
## what's evil is evil you can't have it both ways 
## what's right is right what's wrong is wrong so  



645
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,000
## don't try you have to do it do you think 
## you'll go vegan um i can definitely try yeah  



646
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:00,000
## wow i love my family here but i can stop i can 
## spread it through my family make sure that they
