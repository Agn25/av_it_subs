02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:10,000
## which is really just trying to be liked 
## which is really focusing on getting  



1458
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:14,399
## compassion from the abusers as opposed to 
## focusing your compassion on the victims



1459
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:19,840
## does that help



1460
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:42,479
## all right moving on thank you for your comments 
## guys but um i'm going to move on so on to the next  



1461
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:45,679
## people already know how to go 
## vegan this is the why versus how  



1462
02:40:46,399 --> 02:40:52,160
## people already know how to go vegan with the 
## constant availability of google and the internet  



1463
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:58,160
## people are literally glued to their phones in 
## 2020. anybody can figure out how to become vegan  



1464
02:40:58,160 --> 02:41:03,760
## instantly in order for people to feel the need to 
## become vegan they need to be held accountable for  



1465
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:11,520
## why they said for why they should do it my vision 
## is going blurry at this point i'll read that again  



1466
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:16,000
## in order for people to feel the need to become 
## vegan they need to be held accountable for  



1467
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:24,319
## why they should do it with any other injustice you 
## would never focus on the how by talking about how  



1468
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:31,600
## to not participate in the violence so i'm 
## reading this incorrectly let me start again  



1469
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:35,920
## with any other injustice you would never 
## focus on the how by talking about how  



1470
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:42,000
## to not participate in the violence focusing on the 
## how in the context of any other injustice would be  



1471
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:57,840
## an insult to the victims and the entire movement 
## fighting to end their oppression 30 seconds



1472
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:08,000
## how do you convince intersectionals to 
## be vegan intersectionals to be vegan  



1473
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:15,200
## i'm assuming they're not vegan then usually i 
## find intersectionals are vegan but if they're  



1474
02:42:15,200 --> 02:42:19,519
## if they're not even vegan you i would just 
## say to talk to them like you talk to anybody



1475
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:25,840
## else



1476
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:52,880
## yes moving on guys thank you on to the next 
## slide vegetarianism is cancer to animal rights  



1477
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:57,600
## vegetarians are non-vegans and should be 
## outreached in the same manner as anyone else  



1478
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:05,680
## and in most cases even harder because vegetarians 
## act so pompous vegetarians are our target market  



1479
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:10,640
## they're no different to paleo eaters 
## why should we treat them any differently



1480
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:21,280
## they are not allies don't let other non-vegans 
## and vegans manipulate you into thinking that  



1481
02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:26,960
## they are 30 seconds i don't have 
## anything to add to these points if



1482
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:36,960
## if i'm just moving straight into looking at 
## the comments and it doesn't look like you guys



1483
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:42,000
## want me to expand on this 
## it's pretty straightforward



1484
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:54,000
## all right five seconds vegetarians 
## are proper carnists yeah well said  



1485
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:59,360
## they should get tenfold harsher 
## activism especially if they're pompous  



1486
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:06,960
## especially if they're pompous all right 
## moving on typical outreach structure ask  



1487
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:10,399
## them if they would like to know why 
## you're here this was asked earlier  



1488
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:16,720
## ask them if they would like to know why you're 
## here and with the context of the footage playing  



1489
02:44:17,279 --> 02:44:22,399
## tell them what the cube of truth sets out to 
## do what we are doing is showing the reality of  



1490
02:44:22,399 --> 02:44:27,920
## what happens to animals and the meat dairy 
## egg and other industries everything you see  



1491
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:34,480
## here is standard practice here and around the 
## world asking the following open-ended question  



1492
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:40,640
## what are your feelings on animal abuse 
## then confirm their stance to form moral  



1493
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:59,840
## consistency with something like so it's safe to 
## say that you are against animal abuse 30 seconds
