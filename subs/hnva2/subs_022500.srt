1335
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:14,080
## um like if they had a dog with them and they 
## obviously care about their dog like they're  



1336
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:18,319
## walking with the dog and then they're showing 
## you know like empathy for their dog in some way  



1337
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:23,840
## and you say well what if that dog was stabbed to 
## death yeah it's an easy thing to agree with yep  



1338
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:30,241
## but what happens when that dog dies in the family 
## how long will they take to grieve that dog's life  



1339
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:38,479
## compared to a human compared to how sad 
## they would feel about their own death and  



1340
02:25:38,479 --> 02:25:41,439
## if they were going to be 
## murdered you see what i'm saying



1341
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:49,040
## all right i'm going to move on i don't 
## see any comments here wanting me to  



1342
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:53,120
## expand on this particular slide i think i've 
## covered as much as i can so let's move on  



1343
02:25:55,040 --> 02:26:01,920
## statistics keep them minimal outside of what is 
## asked of you state minimal information during  



1344
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:08,240
## outreach conversations we are not on the streets 
## to verbally leaflet again let the footage provide  



1345
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:14,639
## the context to the conversation you aren't at a 
## cube of truth to be a statistician you're there  



1346
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:21,920
## to have a concise conversation that holds people 
## to account for their unjustified animal abuse a  



1347
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:27,120
## conversation will go on for longer than necessary 
## if it turns into an argument over statistic  



1348
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:33,520
## over statistics this is another reason why you 
## should bring up health and environment talking  



1349
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:40,241
## points why you shouldn't pardon me this is another 
## reason why you shouldn't bring up health and  



1350
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:46,319
## environment talking points because that usually 
## leads into a never-ending debate about nothingness  



1351
02:26:47,680 --> 02:27:01,840
## seconds if you guys have any points 
## you want me to expand on let me know



1352
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,399
## yeah this is a good point 
## here if the conversation went  



1353
02:27:08,399 --> 02:27:15,920
## to logic i usually believe the person won't 
## go vegan try to keep it about the abuse and  



1354
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:20,160
## here it says best of a logic person is to 
## go plant-based veganisms from your heart  



1355
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:27,519
## you do need to hit people in the chest people 
## talk part of me you're talking about how  



1356
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:31,840
## you know it's how you make people feel 
## that's what people are going to remember



1357
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:34,639
## moving on



1358
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:42,161
## yeah it's not a debate club on the streets very 
## good point street activism is not a debate club  



1359
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:50,479
## moving on guys reachability and conversation 
## length not everybody on the streets is worth  



1360
02:27:50,479 --> 02:27:56,240
## talking to part of your role is to assess 
## who is reachable and who is not many people  



1361
02:27:56,240 --> 02:28:02,080
## are not reachable if they want to have a short 
## conversation with you keep it short with them  



1362
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:07,280
## don't entertain bystanders who want to engage 
## in long argumentative debates we just covered  



1363
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:13,519
## that do not underestimate the cunningness 
## of non-vegan guilt and the ability that non  



1364
02:28:14,319 --> 02:28:19,120
## vegans many non-vegans will have to waste 
## your vital time at work for the animals  



1365
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:22,399
## that's a huge point that last one 30



1366
02:28:22,399 --> 02:28:25,839
## seconds



1367
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:47,520
## yeah part of the game here 
## is assessing who is reachable  



1368
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:53,840
## you get better at this with practice by the way



1369
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:11,040
## yeah well jezebel you're right it's also logical 
## the point here is to not get lost in the logic  



1370
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:14,640
## you have to also have what 
## hits people in the chest too



1371
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:23,439
## cunningness what is cunningness you 
## mean the actual definition of the word



1372
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:33,760
## let's look it up the actual definition of 
## the word according to miriam webster is  



1373
02:29:34,399 --> 02:29:40,000
## skill in achieving one's ends through 
## indirect subtle or underhanded means



1374
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:47,200
## and here's an example it took a certain amount of 
## cunningness on the photographer's part to obtain  



1375
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:55,040
## such revealing portraits of his rich and famous 
## subjects anyhow the way it applies here in this  



1376
02:29:55,040 --> 02:30:02,160
## context is that non-vegans are very cunning in the 
## way that they address these arguments with vegans
