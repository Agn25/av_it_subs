01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,800
## particularly as people seem to not acknowledge 
## their sentience or even have any regard for  



953
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:11,520
## them as if they're not relevant other 
## than as a commodity so i've found that  



954
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:16,800
## by trying to get people to engage their 
## compassion or even their sense of justice around



955
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:26,720
## animals yeah and you're the only one who's 
## making them visible or attempting to at  



956
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:35,840
## this point yes like they know that that you know 
## advertising exists but they actually don't connect



957
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:45,440
## they have to disconnect in order to sleep at night 
## and what you represent is a mirror you're a mirror  



958
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:50,720
## and when they call you hateful you are actually 
## hateful but not to them you're hateful to their  



959
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:55,360
## actions they're the abuse that's occurring to the 
## animals so don't again don't let people shame you  



960
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:01,360
## out of these things yes you are hateful own it 
## you are hateful you do hate what they're doing  



961
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:05,280
## to animals that's why you're speaking up and 
## that's why you're passionate you're not just  



962
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:09,520
## passionate this is an art we're talking about 
## you're not just passionate about this this is  



963
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:15,840
## an injustice and you are angry you hate the fact 
## that your friends people you love are so willing  



964
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:21,600
## to make excuses for something 
## so unbelievably unjustifiable  



965
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:29,200
## right that's what you hate the fact that they're 
## yeah but like even the people that you outreach to  



966
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:36,800
## like actually trying to make them feel something 
## though because it could be on their radar



967
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,760
## what from what you've told me i actually think 
## that they do have it on their radar because  



968
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:47,840
## that's why they're trying to disconnect and call 
## you hateful things when they say things that are  



969
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,880
## inaccurate and irrational it's a sign that they 
## do have guilt and guilt is a sign of them caring  



970
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:57,440
## about the subject it's just so far buried down 
## there because that's where it needs to be for  



971
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:04,400
## them to sleep at do you understand these people 
## do care about this issue you're just living proof  



972
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:11,280
## of it being made into action and having your your 
## actions aligned with your morals and you represent  



973
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:15,360
## something to them that makes them feel 
## inadequate and they should [ __ ] feel that way



974
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:20,000
## you do hate what they're doing 
## to the animals let them know that  



975
01:42:20,640 --> 01:42:24,720
## that you don't respect what they're doing to 
## the animals and there's no way that they can  



976
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:29,600
## justify it keep asking them how do you justify 
## this even if you think that a cow doesn't feel  



977
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:34,560
## the same way as a dog or the same way more 
## importantly don't use a dog as an example use them  



978
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:39,280
## how would you feel if you're in a cow's position 
## what crime has a cow committed other than being  



979
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:45,520
## born non-human there's no way they can justify so 
## asking these basic questions usually will lead you  



980
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:55,040
## to having them face the facts and a vegan well 
## they may temporarily but if that's the reason i  



981
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:59,760
## don't talk to you anymore for someone who is a 
## concerned citizen speaking up against injustice  



982
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:06,720
## then they're not really your friend are they 
## friends don't abandon friends over something so  



983
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:12,880
## obviously righteous like that even if they're 
## the perpetrator again they can't justify it  



984
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:18,080
## a real friend would be like you know what i 
## respect the fact that you called me out and  



985
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:23,680
## there's nothing i can say like i am hypocrite 
## and i am an animal abuser or even if they don't  



986
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,040
## admit to that they would at least keep you in 
## their lives if they respected the fact that  



987
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,800
## you're speaking up against this and then it's 
## up to you how long you keep them in your lives



988
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,840
## does that help yeah thanks a lot cool



989
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:59,600
## stop share so there it is that was the holding 
## non-vegans accountable 2.0 from perth australia  



990
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:04,320
## that was the second stop on the australian leg  



991
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,040
## of the world tour that we 
## embarked on in february which got



992
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:14,000
## put to an end due to the coronavirus  



993
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,840
## so i will take questions and i will also 
## start using this presentation with the  



994
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:24,720
## slides to break down this whole thing once over 
## just to reiterate all the points that were made



995
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,560
## it is good to feel bad about 
## something that is bad simple  



996
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:42,720
## i love simplicity and effectiveness 
## the simpler the better



997
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,920
## in terms of effectiveness it has 
## to have that effectiveness there  



998
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:51,840
## but the simplicity i just love that so much okay
