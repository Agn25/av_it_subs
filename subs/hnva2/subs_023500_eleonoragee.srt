1417
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:22,799
## sales is too much practical veganism 
## is more from the from our internals  



1418
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:25,840
## not sure what you mean there soilless magician



1419
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:32,479
## is it good to start with the socratic method 
## to get to know where the individual is  



1420
02:35:32,479 --> 02:35:35,919
## at well socratic questioning is 
## something that we touch on in this  



1421
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:42,080
## so jazz just stick around and i'll get into 
## that further all right guys i'm gonna move on



1422
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:46,080
## okay that does help good let's move on



1423
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,120
## the socratic the very next slide there it is jazz



1424
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:03,760
## maybe we sensed the line of questions that 
## might come from you guys and that's why we  



1425
02:36:03,760 --> 02:36:07,440
## put this slide next all right so socratic 
## the socratic method socratic questioning  



1426
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:13,359
## is a communication tool that we use within our 
## approach it is not an approach in and of itself  



1427
02:36:15,359 --> 02:36:21,759
## and neither is the sales thing where we ask 
## questions to lead the bystander to their own  



1428
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:27,680
## conclusions so yes jazz you're right and i'll 
## read that again okay so credit questioning is  



1429
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:32,480
## a communication tool that we use within our 
## approach it is not an approach in and of itself  



1430
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:36,799
## where we ask questions to lead the 
## bystander to their own conclusions  



1431
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:45,839
## use open-ended questions such as why are you sorry 
## let me start again use open-ended questions such  



1432
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:51,840
## as why are you against animal abuse instead of 
## a closed statement such as animal abuse is wrong  



1433
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:56,160
## open-ended questions are 
## generally prefer preferred  



1434
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:03,520
## i've got a problem with speaking today open-ended 
## questions are generally preferred to anchor  



1435
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:17,840
## and progress the conversation you should use 
## closed-ended questions and statements 30 seconds  



1436
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:25,120
## would it be possible to ask the non-vegan to give 
## us feedback on the conversation they had well



1437
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:31,839
## we kind of do at the end we say what do you 
## think you'll do that gives you the answer



1438
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:45,840
## and danya if i'm saying 
## you're not your name correctly  



1439
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:48,400
## dania could you also point out the tip about



1440
02:37:50,479 --> 02:37:52,799
## open-ended questions are generally preferred  



1441
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:58,160
## to anchor and progress the conversation you 
## should you should use closed-ended questions and  



1442
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:02,880
## statements so we're not saying use open-ended 
## questions all the time that's just ridiculous



1443
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:13,840
## but generally they are preferred i'm 
## going to move on now to the next slide  



1444
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:23,200
## you versus we we don't torture animals and kill 
## animals for products non-vegans do using we  



1445
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:29,200
## undermines individual accountability when you tell 
## non-vegans that we as a society are responsible  



1446
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:35,359
## for animal cruelty in farms it takes away the 
## imperative for the individual accountability it  



1447
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:44,160
## makes them think of lobbying government programs 
## etc instead of personal responsibilities people  



1448
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:48,880
## need to feel guilty to change they'll only change 
## once they understand that there is a difference  



1449
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:55,840
## between you the vegan and them the non-vegan 
## and that difference needs to be very clear



1450
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:09,840
## 30 seconds



1451
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:28,960
## i can add and say that guilt is the only way 
## in my opinion to get people to go vegan not  



1452
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:34,080
## plant-based but transform them into a vegan 
## activist that's gonna change the [ __ ] world



1453
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:37,840
## amen



1454
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:52,160
## um can we mean i was in the same boat as 
## the non-vegan well that's the thing it's  



1455
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:58,559
## being used that way but when you say we you no 
## longer do it so it's just completely inaccurate  



1456
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:03,680
## you're making an inaccurate statement 
## in an effort to seem more humble
