1168
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:06,560
## i'm just teaching you guys what i've learned 
## and what we've learned together actually so



1169
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:17,360
## not verbal leafleting is the biggest 
## part of this slide no verbal leafleting  



1170
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:23,920
## that's just cancer in the animal rights movement 
## i've seen it so many times i've done it myself  



1171
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:29,680
## it gets you nowhere and it makes this message 
## seem even more of a like a mockery to people  



1172
02:05:29,680 --> 02:05:36,320
## like it's it takes it takes it down a notch to 
## then being taken less seriously so all right  



1173
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:52,640
## that's 45 seconds moving on veganism is not 
## love or compassion veganism is about justice  



1174
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:59,440
## your likability does not determine your rights so 
## out i'm going to repeat that just because someone  



1175
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:02,960
## doesn't like you it doesn't mean they have 
## the right to take your rights away from you  



1176
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:09,040
## so that's why we don't need to lean into how much 
## people like animals that's just the wrong way to  



1177
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:15,440
## communicate this message outreach is not about 
## how you or anyone else feels about animals if  



1178
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:20,800
## you don't go around beating children you aren't 
## instantly a compassionate individual refraining  



1179
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:26,560
## from injustice does not make you compassionate by 
## default and we can see that because in the animal  



1180
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:32,080
## rights movement vegans are some of the least 
## compassionate people that i have to deal with  



1181
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:39,520
## veganism is a non-action it's not loving 
## it's merely the right thing to do 45



1182
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:43,840
## seconds



1183
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,840
## all right i'm reading your comments guys if  



1184
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:57,840
## there's anything you want me 
## to expand on now's your time



1185
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:26,240
## you know what i'm going to reduce this back down 
## to 30 seconds uh and if you guys like need more  



1186
02:07:26,240 --> 02:07:33,200
## time to write your comment just start off with 
## a comment that you can just send out real quick  



1187
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:38,560
## that says i have a comment or i have something 
## i want to add and then i will wait for you to  



1188
02:07:38,560 --> 02:07:43,120
## write your longer question if this is too quick 
## so i'm going to reduce this back to 30 seconds  



1189
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:47,440
## and that's what you can do if you have any 
## questions but there are questions coming in now  



1190
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:53,760
## so i will answer them what does leaf litting mean 
## leafleting means handing out pieces of information  



1191
02:07:53,760 --> 02:08:00,720
## to people and then it's just like all these little 
## factoids about like how old chickens are when  



1192
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:08,080
## they're murdered and all these things and you know 
## the the irony of how counterproductive this is is  



1193
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:15,840
## obvious to me because so many non-vegans already 
## know about how much of a shocker the meat dairy  



1194
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:21,120
## and egg industries are they already know that they 
## treat animals horribly they already know about how  



1195
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:26,240
## young the animals are when they're murdered and 
## all these crazy statistics and it's very easy  



1196
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:32,640
## to find out but it doesn't make people go vegan 
## because knowing all these factoids is one thing  



1197
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:37,840
## and yes that might cause some people to go 
## vegan i take that back i know some of you  



1198
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:41,600
## thinking well i went vegan when i looked 
## into the dairy industry but at some point  



1199
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:46,720
## there was accountability for your actions and 
## wanting to be accountable for yourself for what  



1200
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:53,120
## you're doing to them and yeah that's what it 
## comes down to these factoids don't really push  



1201
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:57,200
## people towards it it just puts them in a position 
## where they just feel like they need to continue  



1202
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:03,840
## arguing the points and all this stuff and it's 
## just it's not it's not very effective at all so



1203
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,680
## let's see if there's any other comments here



1204
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:18,400
## ariane huge comment very well said people 
## will forget about the facts anyways  



1205
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:22,320
## what they will remember is the 
## guilty feeling when they hear  



1206
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:28,480
## that they are animal abusers so just to expand 
## on ariane's point here and point out how  



1207
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:35,440
## how true that is there's a really great quote that 
## everyone knows and it's just so true people don't  



1208
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:45,840
## remember what you said they remember how they felt 
## when you said it and that's what this is all about



1209
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:57,600
## yeah veganism is about justice we 
## can't point that out enough seemingly  



1210
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:05,040
## so we cannot point it out enough all right moving 
## on guys thanks for your comments i appreciate it
