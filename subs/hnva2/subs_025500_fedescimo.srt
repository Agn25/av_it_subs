1575
02:55:03,279 --> 02:55:15,840
## end the conversation with the statement 30 seconds



1576
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:35,280
## from a outsider point of view this vegan 
## approach is genius david velas is in the comments  



1577
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:45,760
## and seems effective and david is not vegan joining 
## us and giving his feedback on this approach  



1578
02:55:45,760 --> 02:55:52,240
## i appreciate it david i appreciate your 
## feedback but you know that this is going to be  



1579
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:56,000
## a huge thing for you that you have to 
## face because this whole conversation  



1580
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:01,920
## if you're telling us it's effective what we 
## really want to know is how effective is it for you



1581
02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:08,000
## all right let's move on



1582
02:56:10,240 --> 02:56:13,519
## so this is the last slide guys



1583
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:20,720
## closing the conversation an effective statement 
## in this situation can be so keep in mind that for  



1584
02:56:20,720 --> 02:56:25,680
## however long that you're not vegan animals 
## will be abused and tortured because of you  



1585
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:30,640
## so when you're ready to stop abusing animals 
## and align your actions with your words  



1586
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:36,241
## you know what to do so think about what side 
## of history you want to stand on and that closed  



1587
02:56:37,359 --> 02:56:41,599
## um that closes the conversation but this is also  



1588
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:53,840
## the question that we have for you david this 
## question is for you what are you going to do



1589
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:08,000
## your question david i'm not sure on  



1590
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:12,240
## uh how would i respond to someone 
## saying that they would hire animals



1591
02:57:14,560 --> 02:57:19,520
## it's i don't i've never heard that before but 
## hiring i'm not sure if you've used the wrong word  



1592
02:57:19,520 --> 02:57:24,720
## there but hiring animals is still exploitation 
## that's just another word for enslaving animals



1593
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:29,040
## but i'm not quite sure i 
## understand your question there
