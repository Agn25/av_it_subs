1001
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:08,560
## okay where is this



1002
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:15,680
## here we are



1003
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:23,360
## all right so i'm going to go 
## over everything once more just  



1004
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,480
## to reiterate all these points and make 
## sure you guys fully understand them  



1005
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:33,680
## there was a complaint about my speaking voice 
## how is the audio coming through let me know



1006
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:43,840
## oh



1007
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:47,280
## nope this isn't it



1008
01:45:52,320 --> 01:46:11,840
## this is it um



1009
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:20,720
## um okay so question by carlo hi paul 
## once you understand that the person  



1010
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:25,840
## you are talking to is not going to be interested 
## in the topic and continues justifying animal abuse  



1011
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:32,800
## what do you say to them before going away all 
## these examples you saw and everything that we  



1012
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,520
## said in the approach applies to these 
## individuals the only difference is that  



1013
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:45,520
## at some i'm assuming that these people 
## probably at a cube of truth probably  



1014
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:49,840
## won't even stop but if they do stop and 
## you're talking to them at some point  



1015
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:57,680
## it could be really powerful for you to just end 
## the discussion with that that uh statement that  



1016
01:46:57,680 --> 01:47:05,440
## was made at the end of the interaction you saw 
## examples from hudson and jacob um just know that  



1017
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:12,240
## for as long as you remain non-vegan these animals 
## will be tortured and abused because of you and  



1018
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:20,000
## just decide what side of history so i'll 
## i'll leave this with you to think about but  



1019
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:26,320
## you ultimately will need to decide which side of 
## history you want to stand on something powerful  



1020
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:32,000
## like that a statement like that is all you can 
## really do with those individuals and i i just want  



1021
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,840
## to say that it's important that you respect your 
## time as an activist and that you're not wasting  



1022
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:45,120
## your breath on people so it's very powerful to 
## say to the individual that you would like to  



1023
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:50,160
## carry on your work with those who are like you'd 
## like to move on you know so ending the discussion  



1024
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:54,000
## and moving on after you make that statement is 
## super powerful and that's what you should do



1025
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:07,200
## audio is fine good thank you guys 
## i've got the slide ready i'm just  



1026
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:17,840
## going to read through your comments 
## and see if there's any questions



1027
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:27,120
## david's saying i would only say i 
## wouldn't mind if an animal killed me  



1028
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:32,400
## but i would say i would eat you would say 
## that you would eat a human okay david you uh  



1029
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:38,000
## you sound a bit confused buddy i don't 
## think you would be okay with an animal  



1030
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,320
## eating you if you had a choice and 
## you have a choice not to eat animals  



1031
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:51,680
## so you're the oppressor and the power is in your 
## hands to end the suffering and abuse and torture  



1032
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:59,200
## that you would inflict on these animals otherwise 
## if you choose to continue to be a non-vegan human  



1033
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:05,760
## supremacist because that's what non-vegans are 
## human supremacists and you are subscribing to this  



1034
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:10,800
## death cult you're subscribing to this 
## idea that animals should be reduced  



1035
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:17,680
## to a sandwich through violent 
## beheadings and enslavement and torture



1036
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:27,840
## david says it's an excuse but i'm 
## addicted addiction isn't a justification  



1037
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,880
## so let's hope that david gets the message 
## here and does actually connect his actions  



1038
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:40,560
## to his words and ends his hypocrisy for real but 
## let's move on to your other questions here guys  



1039
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:47,440
## can you say something about infighting between 
## vegans and outreach organizations i hate it and  



1040
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:53,360
## how to stop this welcome to the animal rights 
## movement if you know how i can stop this i'd  



1041
01:49:53,360 --> 01:50:00,880
## like to know um vegans are the biggest threat 
## to the animal rights movement i've been saying
