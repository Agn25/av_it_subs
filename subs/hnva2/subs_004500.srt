405
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,640
## you will actually get the health benefits from 
## doing this as well and i used to say that it's  



406
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,760
## better for the environment if you do this as a 
## benefit you have a lower footprint it's a mistake  



407
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,840
## because i'm conflating animal rights with 
## environmentalism and with human health



408
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,560
## i know that it's going to be tempting for you to 
## do this even after this workshop you're going to  



409
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:31,840
## be very tempted to go there still i i you only 
## know whether this is true if you apply this  



410
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,800
## but if i can save you some time it's a 
## mistake focus on why as opposed to how  



411
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:45,840
## way more focus on why how is so eat i 
## mean it's so easy to go vegan all right



412
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,400
## so i just want to add some commentary there 
## to that piece that i just shared with you  



413
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,800
## guys and i'm not sure if i made this clear in 
## that last piece of commentary i offered but  



414
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:04,720
## that three-step process is not something you 
## necessarily need to follow at the cubes i'm just  



415
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,840
## breaking that down to explain the traditional 
## sales process and how it can be like how it's  



416
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,280
## applicable here and how we usually get people you 
## know what the process is to get them to that point  



417
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,760
## of taking veganism seriously but i'm going to 
## break down the process for you at the end of this  



418
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:34,800
## in in slides so i'm gonna break it down for you 
## even more um simpler and make it more clearer for  



419
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:41,600
## you guys so just stick around for that at the end 
## after this presentation is complete so i just want  



420
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,720
## to clarify i'm not asking you to do the three-step 
## process at the cubes that's not what we're asking  



421
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,200
## you to do we're just explaining the three-step 
## process and showing you how this one little thing  



422
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:59,680
## in sales is actually something that we can learn 
## from and apply some of that here in activism  



423
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,600
## in this day and age do we really think it's 
## difficult for people like we create our  



424
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:11,520
## way more focus on if you apply how is 
## so eat i mean it's so easy to go vegan  



425
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:20,160
## it's a mistake focus on why as opposed to 
## how way more focus on why how is so eat  



426
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,440
## i mean it's so easy to go vegan in this day and 
## age do we really think it's difficult for people  



427
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,000
## like we create all these programs and recipes and 
## we try to make sure people have all the support  



428
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:38,240
## in the world is it really that difficult though 
## aren't we babying people aren't we coddling people  



429
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:43,520
## because if you're convinced on why you need to 
## be vegan you just need to go and use google in  



430
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,120
## 2020 we have the internet you can use google and 
## ask any question there is about any ingredients  



431
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,520
## about any recipe any product and you'll find out 
## pretty quickly if it's vegan or not and that's the  



432
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:01,120
## only compass you need to be vegan is this vegan 
## or is this not there's two types of people in  



433
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,400
## the world those who say being vegan is easy those 
## who say being vegan is hard those who say being  



434
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,120
## vegan is easier focus on the victims those who 
## say being vegan is hard to focus on themselves  



435
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,280
## so whenever they bring up that distraction 
## oh i don't know how i could do this  



436
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,600
## how whatever form of how that comes 
## up how is completely a distraction  



437
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,680
## if they're sold on why how is easy plus we 
## give them a card anyway so they get support  



438
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,920
## they get whatever they need at the end so 
## don't focus on how another good question



439
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,720
## i just want to let you guys know also we 
## updated our resource page in our cards so when  



440
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,360
## you're so when you're at the end of the 
## interaction and you hand over a card  



441
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:56,960
## it it's now updated and it says will you stop 
## um what does it say will you stop being a human  



442
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:03,200
## supremacist this was just updated and it has 
## our website cubeoftruth.com and that link now  



443
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,760
## takes you to our resources page so it's a lot 
## more simple i'm really proud of this new update  



444
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,120
## and if you go over to our resources page we've 
## updated that as well to make that even simpler  



445
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:22,080
## specifically the video section we've now put up a 
## video that is the best of the best gary yourofsky  



446
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,960
## moments in speeches and other other content 
## he's put up mainly his speeches but we've  



447
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,760
## put the best of the best of gary yourofsky 
## all in one video and it's about three hours  



448
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:39,680
## so that's pretty cool because if they need 
## further convincing that's the video we're  



449
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,680
## still going to keep the georgia tech speech up 
## there the best speech you'll ever hear because  



450
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,680
## it has all of the translations available and i 
## think it covers like 30 languages or something so  



451
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,840
## that's important we need to keep that up there 
## for that reason but this other one that's up  



452
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:02,800
## there you can play using the caption feature on 
## youtube so it may still translate through that
