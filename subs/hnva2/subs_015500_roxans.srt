## i just need one of you guys to 
## confirm and then i'll continue  



1099

## can you see the outreach workshop slides



1100
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:55,840
## okay



1101
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:07,760
## all good cool thanks guys all right so let's get 
## into it so this is our outreach workshop in slides  



1102
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:13,920
## you might see organizers in your city or town and 
## if you are an organizer or you become an organizer  



1103
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,960
## your organizer may run through a workshop with 
## you in your city and they'll use these slides  



1104
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:23,840
## and these slides may be updated from time to 
## time but right now this is our most updated  



1105
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:33,280
## outreach workshop in slide format so let's let's 
## go so we start with this important question  



1106
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:37,760
## what even is veganism if you ask a 
## group of people what it means to be  



1107
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:41,520
## vegan you most likely will get multiple 
## versions of what they believe it to be  



1108
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:46,800
## veganism has nothing to do with our health the 
## environment human rights or affection towards  



1109
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:53,520
## animals it is not about justice for non-human 
## animal rights vegan equals anti-animal abuse  



1110
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:58,320
## now i'm not going to make any extra points 
## here unless they naturally come to me  



1111
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:05,280
## but if you guys in the comments want to make any 
## points or any questions about this slide be as  



1112
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:12,240
## quick as you can while this slides up i'm gonna 
## wait two minutes between each slide so that if  



1113
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:17,680
## there's anything specifically that you would like 
## me to address regarding the points on each slide  



1114
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:23,200
## i'll address them as we go so two minutes starting 
## now i'm going to start my stopwatch on my phone



1115
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:30,720
## you know we have to start with the definition 
## of veganism before we even talk about activism  



1116
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:36,720
## so two minutes if anyone wants to 
## discuss anything here let me know



1117
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:47,840
## it's two minutes too long maybe 
## i should just do one minute



1118
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:03,600
## yeah common sense and self-explanatory 
## this slide all right well i'm i'm gonna  



1119
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:09,200
## reduce that to one minute so we've got 30 
## seconds to go i think one minute is plenty  



1120
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:15,840
## i don't have anything i'd like to add to 
## this it's very straightforward like you said



1121
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:24,400
## so 10 seconds i'm assuming 
## there's no questions here  



1122
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:30,960
## i'm an admin of the malaysian vegan facebook 
## group one question we ask people who request  



1123
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:36,000
## to join is what veganism means to them most 
## of them say it's kindness and great health



1124
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:43,840
## wow yeah that's just typical isn't it it's a 
## very common thing in the animal rights movement  



1125
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:48,240
## and the other thing i want to point out is 
## you know when you ask what the benefit is  



1126
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:55,040
## most people say health or the environment which 
## just goes to prove we don't need to talk about  



1127
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:59,440
## health and the environment with people and talk 
## about them as benefits and act like that's what  



1128
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:04,400
## animal rights is all about people already know 
## about those things what they really need to hear
