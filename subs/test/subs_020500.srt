3728
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:03,679
## talking about vegetarianism the longer




3729
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:06,400
## we cuddle vegetarianism




3730
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:07,920
## the longer it will take for animal




3731
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:09,520
## rights to be taken seriously in the




3732
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:12,159
## public eye




3733
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:13,920
## i think i can't remember which one of




3734
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,599
## you said it or if it actually was one of




3735
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:16,079
## you but




3736
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:19,280
## um there was a quote that vegetarians




3737
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,360
## are contributing to one less form of




3738
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:23,440
## animal abuse than a meat-eater




3739
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:25,199
## uh they contribute to every other form




3740
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:27,040
## of animal abuse it's just not




3741
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,199
## just not meat just not flesh and that




3742
02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:30,719
## that was quite for me that was very




3743
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:32,239
## powerful and i feel like that




3744
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:33,679
## that was that was a quote that was a




3745
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:35,119
## sentence that really brought it home to




3746
02:05:35,119 --> 02:05:36,320
## me that actually yeah




3747
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:38,639
## we we we should be targeting




3748
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:40,480
## vegetarianism




3749
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,760
## as you know just the same as we would




3750
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,000
## target anyone else you know who's a




3751
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,280
## non-vegan because it's just it's just




3752
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:46,239
## there's only one




3753
02:05:46,239 --> 02:05:48,880
## between them even more yeah even more




3754
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:49,520
## because




3755
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,280
## non-vegans don't say you don't need to




3756
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:54,159
## talk to me unknown




3757
02:05:54,159 --> 02:05:56,079
## they know that they need that's the




3758
02:05:56,079 --> 02:05:57,760
## correct conversation to have with them




3759
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,159
## they know that they're culpable




3760
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:01,840
## right it's the same as someone who's




3761
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,440
## non-vegan who doesn't support animal




3762
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,280
## testing they never buy cosmetics




3763
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:08,239
## that are tested on on animals i mean




3764
02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:09,920
## they don't support one form of animal




3765
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,159
## injustice yeah there are many non-vegans




3766
02:06:12,159 --> 02:06:15,520
## they don't claim that claim to be exempt




3767
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:16,960
## from the message regarding meat dairy




3768
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:17,840
## and eggs




3769
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:19,840
## vegetarians do claim to be exempt from




3770
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,599
## hearing that




3771
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:24,000
## yeah it's just very counterproductive to




3772
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,880
## separate




3773
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,520
## like vegetarians and the rest of




3774
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,440
## non-vegans




3775
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,840
## because i see that a lot from vegans and




3776
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:33,360
## animal rights activists they think that




3777
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:34,560
## they should get a different treatment




3778
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,000
## but really vegetarians are just




3779
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
## non-vegan so let's not separate them




3780
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,159
## the reason why we focus on it is because




3781
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:41,760
## we want to change their mentality it's




3782
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:44,000
## not because there is any difference you




3783
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,040
## know we're not




3784
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,119
## like singling them out it's the same




3785
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:48,560
## it's just non-vegans




3786
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,040
## it's just clarifying the message yeah on




3787
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,199
## behalf of the animals




3788
02:06:53,199 --> 02:06:56,880
## okay perfect yeah i yeah this for me was




3789
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:58,239
## an easy topic because i'm




3790
02:06:58,239 --> 02:07:00,639
## i also uh focus on vegetarians for the




3791
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:01,360
## same reasons




3792
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:03,440
## um i think i think it's something our




3793
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:04,639
## movement really needs to




3794
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:05,840
## needs to shape people need to shake




3795
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:07,280
## their head on this and just realize that




3796
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,960
## these vegetarians they're not helping us




3797
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,320
## they're not our allies




3798
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:13,360
## um understanding veganism doesn't help




3799
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,360
## anyone like oh i understand you or i'm




3800
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:17,040
## supportive of you i'm a vegetarian




3801
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:19,119
## it doesn't mean [ __ ] and i think the




3802
02:07:19,119 --> 02:07:20,320
## more we start to




3803
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:23,040
## realize that the better and the easier




3804
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,199
## things are going to be in the long term




3805
02:07:25,199 --> 02:07:28,480
## um so a style actually i have a specific




3806
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:30,320
## topic for you and this was this was




3807
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,320
## actually only brought up yesterday




3808
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,400
## um so that's why i don't know if you got




3809
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,360
## chance to




3810
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:39,040
## um yeah i'll i'll i'll explain it now so




3811
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:41,040
## basically the impossible burger




3812
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,119
## all right uh you did your video when




3813
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:44,719
## when was it earlier this year i don't




3814
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:45,840
## know if you've thought about it since




3815
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:46,639
## then




3816
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:49,280
## but um i think it's been like two years




3817
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:49,920
## now




3818
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:52,239
## is it two years wow okay i don't know i




3819
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:54,320
## watched it only recently anyway so i




3820
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:55,599
## don't know if you've had chance to




3821
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:57,840
## catch up on on that and or if you still




3822
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:58,719
## think the same




3823
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:00,400
## but um somebody brought this up and




3824
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:01,599
## they're very passionate about it and




3825
02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:02,560
## they wanted to




3826
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:05,520
## uh discuss this um apparently according




3827
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:07,040
## to them again don't know if this is true




3828
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:07,520
## or not




3829
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:10,560
## a lot of people left or at least stopped




3830
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,920
## going to cubes or




3831
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,400
## even some chapters maybe even closed




3832
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:14,960
## over




3833
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:16,719
## a disagreement about the impossible




3834
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:18,400
## burger and the video that you made




3835
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,719
## i watched the video obviously i watched




3836
02:08:20,719 --> 02:08:22,480
## the video i i only watched it yesterday




3837
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:23,840
## so it's fresh in my mind




3838
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,520
## um and your position's on the impossible




3839
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:27,119
## burger and i you know




3840
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:29,040
## went through it um what what how do you




3841
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:31,520
## respond to people who who have this




3842
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:33,440
## like they don't believe that av is




3843
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,520
## abolitionist because of




3844
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:37,760
## you being the founder holding the view




3845
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:38,560
## that you hold that




3846
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:41,679
## uh an impossible burger um is




3847
02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:43,840
## it's it's vegan because they tested on




3848
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:44,880
## animals um




3849
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:47,119
## i'll i'll explain the video if you want




3850
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:48,079
## really quickly for anyone that's




3851
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:49,280
## watching real quick i watched it




3852
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:50,000
## yesterday so it's really




3853
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,159
## fresh in the video asal basically makes




3854
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:53,920
## the position makes the claim i don't




3855
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:56,480
## know takes the position that




3856
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:58,079
## practically every single e number and




3857
02:08:58,079 --> 02:08:59,520
## additive has been tested on animals at




3858
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:00,320
## one point




3859
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,320
## so pretty much every vegan product you




3860
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:03,679
## would buy has




3861
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:05,199
## has something in it that has been tested




3862
02:09:05,199 --> 02:09:06,800
## on animals but not by the company that




3863
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:08,239
## you're buying it from




3864
02:09:08,239 --> 02:09:10,000
## uh the impossible burger and possible




3865
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,159
## foods did the testing themselves




3866
02:09:12,159 --> 02:09:14,239
## and but the product now that's in the




3867
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:16,639
## store technically hasn't been tested on




3868
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:18,320
## it's the product that the one thing that




3869
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,400
## was in it was previously tested




3870
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:21,920
## so therefore it's in the same category




3871
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,760
## as another item that you would buy




3872
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,920
## um they're both been tested at some




3873
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:26,800
## point




3874
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,719
## um and if you take issue with the




3875
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:30,159
## impossible burger




3876
02:09:30,159 --> 02:09:32,480
## then how long does it have to be before




3877
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:33,920
## we don't take issue with it anymore and




3878
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:35,360
## it becomes in the same category as the




3879
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:36,239
## other products




3880
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:38,079
## that have were once tested on animals




3881
02:09:38,079 --> 02:09:39,760
## that's the position that a cell takes




3882
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:42,400
## so if anyone's got a question about that




3883
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,000
## either super chat it or save it for




3884
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:44,719
## later




3885
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:45,840
## but yeah how do you how would you




3886
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,840
## respond to someone now who says right




3887
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:50,159
## that that makes av non-abolitionist




3888
02:09:50,159 --> 02:09:51,280
## because av




3889
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:53,119
## is supporting a product that was tested




3890
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:54,800
## on animals and they take the position




3891
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,239
## that because impossible foods did the




3892
02:09:56,239 --> 02:09:57,119
## testing




3893
02:09:57,119 --> 02:09:59,199
## and they have not actually said they




3894
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:01,040
## wouldn't test the gain so impossible
