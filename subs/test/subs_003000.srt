257
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,960
## but i'm only telling you this because it's the 
## truth and it's what i've learned to be true  




258
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,400
## people avoid animal rights and make you 
## think they don't care about animal rights  




259
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,680
## for a reason it's a distraction like i said 
## they create distractions they don't want to  




260
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:26,960
## face something that's obviously wrong and then you 
## buy into that by then pandering to environment and  




261
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,400
## health people don't care about animals because the 
## way that we advocate veganism to people doesn't  




262
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,800
## care about animals it seems like in this movement 
## the more i hear people advocating for veganism  




263
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:47,360
## the less i hear animal rights being tied into it 
## they quickly get mentioned and then we move on to  




264
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,200
## how this is really bad for the environment and 
## really bad for your health so that's why people  




265
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,360
## don't care about animal rights the vegan movement 
## hasn't been promoting animal rights i also just  




266
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,360
## want to say this those who say that what i'm doing 
## is aggressive that this isn't compassionate well  




267
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,120
## the irony the way i see it is the irony is that 
## when people aren't advocating for the animals  




268
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:18,240
## in the way that they communicate directly then 
## you're actually putting the compassion you want  




269
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,240
## to receive from the abuser before the compassion 
## you're supposed to be extending to the victim  




270
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,080
## i think that's hypocrisy right if we truly 
## are compassionate beings then we need to  




271
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,880
## extend compassion to the victims and when we're 
## talking to the abuser like i've already explained  




272
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,640
## it is actually the truest form of compassion to 
## offer the abuser education what do we usually  




273
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,920
## do with abusers we put them in prison don't we 
## right if these beings were any other species  




274
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,560
## other than a non-human so if they were human 
## these people would be put in prison wouldn't  




275
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,720
## they there would be no conversation 
## on the streets no trying to convince  




276
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,600
## people so this is compassion this is the most 
## compassionate thing we can possibly do is try to  




277
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,960
## wake people up with our words but if we pander 
## and we move away from animal rights when we're  




278
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,400
## talking to people then we're only doing more of 
## an injustice more of a disservice to the animals  




279
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:23,680
## it's not about how people feel about animals do 
## you have a dog at home do you have a cat at home  




280
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:30,640
## a lot of the times we as vegans try to lean on 
## the compassion that we think they already have  




281
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,320
## for animals for non-human animals we use dogs 
## as examples a lot in this movement we try to say  




282
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,400
## would you do this to your dog how would you 
## feel if your dog was eaten what about if a  




283
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,760
## dog was getting beaten up right in front of us 
## right now would you act on it that blows up in  




284
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,480
## our face a lot of the time replace all those 
## cows with dogs just for a moment in your mind




285
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:05,600
## dogs don't produce milk yes they do yeah they do 
## but not like yeah it's hard to i don't i try just  




286
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:13,120
## morally i make that comment just for you to 
## consider it morally what is the difference between  




287
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:26,080
## puppies being raised all the female puppies to 
## get milk out of them instead of cows i don't feel  




288
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,800
## different you don't feel any different why do we 
## think we live in a society that cares about dogs  




289
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,760
## why do we think that i don't understand why our 
## movement thinks that we live in a society full  




290
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:46,960
## of dog lovers if we truly love dogs would we have 
## shelters that kill dogs by the thousand every day  




291
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,840
## around the world clearly if we lived in a 
## society of dog lovers just the same way that we  




292
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,120
## love human children then we'd have people 
## protesting at the front of shelters all the time  




293
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,120
## but that's not happening if you said that stuff 
## to me it wouldn't really work because i was never  




294
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:08,400
## really a dog lover growing up but my point is 
## to say that this isn't an animal conversation  




295
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,960
## this is an accountability conversation if you 
## were talking to me about the blood on my hands  




296
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,280
## if you're talking to me about the harm i'm 
## causing to beings who suffer like i suffer  




297
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,960
## it doesn't matter about how i feel about animals 
## it matters but how i feel about causing suffering  




298
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,240
## i also need to make this clear a lot of people 
## out there think that morality is subjective when  




299
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,400
## it comes to this morality is as objective as 
## it gets it's as black and white as my t-shirt




300
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,200
## when it comes to animal rights people will love 
## for you to think that there's a great area that  




301
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,480
## there's something that you're not considering 
## you're not open-minded enough what about  




302
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,640
## if you're on a deserted island or those who don't 
## have you know access to they always try to bring  




303
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,480
## up great areas to this to see where the morality 
## can slip it doesn't ever slip you're never going  




304
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,840
## to wake up one day and think animal abuse is 
## justified are you you're not gonna go back
