356
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,720
## not sales tools they're communication tools but 
## where these communication tools are applicable  




357
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,560
## from the sales world into activism but again i 
## need to reiterate this i said this in the video  




358
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,920
## sales is not activism just because you 
## have x number of sales years of sales  




359
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,160
## experience doesn't mean you have x number of years 
## experience in activism that's not how this works  




360
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,800
## at all it just means that you've learned a 
## few things about communication that might  




361
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,720
## might be applicable here in activism i found 
## in fact when i go over all of the sales  




362
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,120
## things i've ever learned that most of it is 
## actually unapplicable unequivocally unapplicable  




363
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:54,320
## and that's because the the goal in sales is 
## usually to get someone to sign on the dotted  




364
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,440
## line and there's usually a financial incentive 
## here where and i named it the value-based sales  




365
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,120
## approach from the very beginning in 2016 
## when we started av for the purpose of  




366
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:16,400
## setting it apart from sales in general the common 
## view of sales this is a new i was trying to create  




367
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,080
## something new here where we can carry over what 
## is applicable and what i've found the deeper i've  




368
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,440
## gone into this is that a very minimal amount is 
## actually applicable from the sales world over here  




369
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:36,080
## so with that added commentary on this bit 
## i will now continue for you guys to get  




370
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,760
## somebody convicted in what it is that 
## you're trying to convince them of  




371
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,080
## we have all of the lodge process up to sales one 
## of the traditional things that occurs in sales is  




372
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:52,560
## the three-step process for any sale so i'll talk 
## you through that right now the three-step process  




373
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,280
## is really simple the first step is to get 
## somebody convicted in what it is that you're  




374
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,800
## trying to convince them of we have all the logic 
## all of the reason on our side and it's important  




375
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,920
## to use logic and reason i'm not saying don't use 
## that but if you don't get somebody emotionally  




376
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,160
## convicted in this issue because it's a justice 
## issue then don't expect a shift from anybody  




377
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,240
## that's why i don't like these philosophical 
## discussions that we have with people about  




378
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:32,160
## veganism we have these what seems to be like a bar 
## discussion just food for thought and that's a real  




379
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,160
## issue because that's not what this is supposed to 
## be about this is an accountability conversation  




380
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,760
## and that first step is best achieved when you 
## connect them to the sense of injustice and you  




381
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,960
## hold them accountable to that injustice 
## the second step is to make sure that they  




382
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,080
## understand that they as an individual are 
## responsible that they're in the hot seat  




383
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,760
## this isn't something they can just palm off to 
## the government or palm off to these industries and  




384
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,240
## say we need to focus on petitioning against these 
## industries this is about them as an individual and  




385
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:12,320
## you can't let them get out of that that's your job 
## meat doesn't just harm yourself it harms someone  




386
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,960
## else someone or something do you think an animal 
## is a thing oh okay i'll see where you're going  




387
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,440
## but like let's but that's the problem that's 
## going to be your that's going to be the club  




388
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,640
## the lack of compassion for non-human um you know 
## that's going to be your problem but what about  




389
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,960
## you because i'm talking to you right now do you 
## have a lack of compassion for non-human animals  




390
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,480
## so are you against animal exploitation yes i am 
## okay so what do you think you can do about it




391
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,800
## yeah we're talking yeah i will share 
## this conversation with my family  




392
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,120
## what do you think you will do 
## though yeah i will start more




393
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,400
## the third step once you have achieved that 
## second step through dealing with their objections  




394
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,080
## anchoring it back to accountability once they 
## concede you move on to the third step which is  




395
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,880
## tying in the benefits everybody loves to know 
## what's in it for them right because humans are  




396
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:21,200
## selfish right okay so the number one benefit 
## for you going vegan obviously for the animals  




397
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,720
## it's that they no longer have to be tortured 
## and abused by you but the benefit for you  




398
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,400
## is that you no longer have to abuse them 
## and therefore you're no longer a hypocrite  




399
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,000
## because you say that you're against animal 
## abuse in fact in that very conversation  




400
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,680
## they said that that they're against animal 
## abuse right that's the only reason we're  




401
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,400
## vegan today why you guys are sitting here right 
## now trying to learn about outreach is because  




402
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,400
## you hate the hypocrisy don't you you would never 
## want to live with that hypocrisy again would you  




403
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,120
## more importantly would never want to abuse animals  




404
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,240
## anymore would you i used to say if you do this 
## correctly you eat a whole foods plant-based diet
