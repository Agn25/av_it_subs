02:15:02,240 --> 02:15:07,840
## what part of this is fake challenge them to go 
## into a farm for themselves and see what happens  




1252
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:13,920
## in a slaughterhouse specifically say because 
## that's where all the animals end up right




1253
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:18,160
## uh i




1254
02:15:21,120 --> 02:15:26,400
## i feel that i don't want to be friends with 
## people after giving information anymore  




1255
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:30,000
## who won't go vegan well that's 
## the right position i think  




1256
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,920
## you wouldn't again when you compare this 
## to any other injustice you wouldn't stick  




1257
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:39,200
## around and be friends with people who continue to 
## enslave torture and murder once they know better




1258
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:48,800
## if we were the victims we would not want our 
## advocates to prioritize the environment or our  




1259
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:54,720
## oppressor's health no and it would it would be a 
## huge spit in your face to do that that's the whole  




1260
02:15:54,720 --> 02:16:01,520
## point of clarifying this for you guys because 
## the victims deserve so much better from us to  




1261
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:06,400
## be advocating directly for them and they they do 
## deserve a direct message that's dedicated to them




1262
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:23,040
## yes yes okay um what are some variable ways 
## to start the conversation other than have  




1263
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:26,480
## you seen this type of footage before we don't 
## actually ask that anymore have you seen this  




1264
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:31,520
## type of footage before we do sometimes 
## but in this approach with this update  




1265
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:35,280
## you don't need to ask that in fact what we do 
## is we say would you like to know why we're here  




1266
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:40,240
## um so vegan mark i'm not sure if you're just 
## joining the stream but we did cover this you  




1267
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:44,240
## might want to watch this video back and it will 
## be available for everyone to watch back once i'm  




1268
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:51,200
## done and we did cover that raping is bad for 
## your health yeah that's what it sounds like




1269
02:16:55,439 --> 02:17:00,879
## never met a 100 zero waste and whole food 
## vegan so why expect non-vegans to care  




1270
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:08,240
## exactly summer it's so obvious isn't it i always 
## say health and environment are just consequences  




1271
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:14,719
## of animal abuse and our mentality towards animals 
## and if we want to solve a problem we have to pull  




1272
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:20,560
## the root of evil out very well said david if 
## you said that to me when i wasn't vegan that  




1273
02:17:20,560 --> 02:17:27,121
## would punch me in the stomach in the best way you 
## can see you can say would you like to know why  




1274
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:32,080
## we're here today yes thank you jaz you've been 
## paying attention all right cool let's move on




1275
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:43,040
## why don't people care about ethics let's explore 
## that because vegans don't advocate for animals  




1276
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:50,960
## correctly they focus on things like plant-based 
## recipes restaurants weight loss or deforestation  




1277
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:56,240
## another reason is they lead with 
## phrases like friends not food  




1278
02:17:56,240 --> 02:18:02,080
## or animal lovers don't eat animals this 
## is not a conversation about sympathy  




1279
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:09,120
## this is a conversation about accountability 
## don't plead with bystanders make them understand  




1280
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:13,040
## the consequences of their choices by 
## placing them in the victim's position  




1281
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:23,840
## 30 seconds i don't have anything else to add 
## to this unless you guys want me to expand on it




1282
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:42,559
## um check out the majority of vegans online 
## rather not just on instagram vegan king  




1283
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:47,280
## they don't even talk about animals yeah 
## it seems like in this movement that the  




1284
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:54,240
## animals barely get a mention they barely get a 
## shout out and we quickly move on to humans and  




1285
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:58,080
## humans humans humans how does this 
## affect humans let's talk about that




1286
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:02,240
## when humans are the oppressors it's just




1287
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:05,840
## backwards




1288
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:15,760
## all right cool you guys don't have anything uh you 
## want me to expand on here so i'm going to move on  




1289
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:22,160
## all right next slide morality is black and white 
## when it comes to this issue specifically i'm  




1290
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:27,760
## talking about guys okay i'm not talking about 
## these fringe gray area examples that could be  




1291
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:34,320
## brought up with very insignificant choices 
## you could say this is very significant and  




1292
02:19:34,319 --> 02:19:40,240
## it's involving in it's involving oppression so 
## when you're talking about an issue of oppression  




1293
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:48,559
## where there are victims involved morality is black 
## and white when it comes to that if bystanders tell  




1294
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:54,560
## you that you aren't considering the other side 
## to this or you aren't open-minded enough that is  




1295
02:19:54,560 --> 02:20:02,081
## a distraction there is no other side to needless 
## animal abuse you either support it or you don't
