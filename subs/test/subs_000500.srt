144
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
## like any kind of justification for




145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,680
## wanting that done




146
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,160
## or was it just a we request that you do




147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
## this




148
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,240
## well it seemed like it was




149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,919
## out of the uh concern for joey's




150
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,560
## image or his uh reputation yeah




151
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
## so so far to get it straight there the




152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
## requirements so




153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
## the requirements for the donor to




154
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,039
## continue funding av




155
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,080
## are that you delete those videos




156
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
## um give them uh of some i don't know




157
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
## financial




158
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
## organization access to all of your




159
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,880
## records um




160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
## is the board of directors things still




161
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,759
## going they still want you to do that as




162
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
## well is that still on the cards or did




163
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,840
## they pull that




164
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
## like well here's the thing you know




165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,880
## there were




166
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
## things mentioned in the email that we




167
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
## got from the donor but we don't even




168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,199
## know what




169
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
## exactly are the expectations on on their




170
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,880
## side




171
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
## and so that's why we wanted to have a




172
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
## conversation with them but at this point




173
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
## at this point we're not getting




174
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
## we're not getting that do you think it's




175
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,840
## possible that they did that




176
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,039
## to save a face as in they




177
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,960
## that joey was involved and gave that




178
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,120
## response to try to kind of




179
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,199
## yeah save face basically would that be




180
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,720
## that's fair to say or do you think that




181
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,840
## that he actually




182
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
## or she i don't know the donor didn't




183
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
## they actually want to rectify things or




184
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,520
## is it just to try to repair some of the




185
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,440
## damage to the reputation of joey and




186
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,639
## the donor i mean even in my most




187
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,360
## charitable of moods towards this




188
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
## i can't see it any other way




189
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,479
## yeah it feels like that i mean




190
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,080
## from an outside perspective




191
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,759
## unfortunately it does feel like it was




192
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,240
## just an attempt to maybe uh




193
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
## i don't know get the upper hand take the




194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,639
## high road you know or appear to be




195
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,080
## taking the high road but it's




196
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,240
## it's really sad to hear that actually




197
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
## you you actually took the decision to




198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
## take the high road with them and then




199
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,880
## they just didn't respond which um yeah




200
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
## it's disappointing when we heard that




201
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,360
## there was this interest to continue




202
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
## funding us and have another conversation




203
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,759
## then we're like great




204
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
## let's have a conversation but then you




205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,360
## know we're not going to be bored




206
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,400
## and bossed around and




207
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,360
## that's not what we designed a v for it's




208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
## in fact the opposite of that




209
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
## and that's part of the reason why we're




210
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
## at this point




211
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
## that we're at and the reason why we have




212
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,319
## an organic following




213
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,599
## and you know




214
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,039
## it's i think there's just a




215
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,039
## misunderstanding of what we do from the




216
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,160
## donor's perspective




217
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
## and i think that they don't really




218
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
## understand that work and they don't




219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,919
## really understand us and what our




220
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,440
## mission is and




221
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
## and they they perhaps got involved




222
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,759
## without doing their homework and




223
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,479
## we wanted to have a conversation so that




224
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,280
## we could




225
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,319
## get on the same page about things and




226
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,919
## we're not able to do that at this point




227
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
## so that's where everything is left




228
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
## at this point yeah i understand i




229
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,400
## understand




230
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
## and it's it's it's something that it's




231
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,840
## not a surprise that




232
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
## that the donor or anyone basically is




233
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,039
## having




234
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,840
## some kind of uh you know let's say




235
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,199
## strong opinion




236
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,000
## towards being like kind of anti-av this




237
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
## seems to be quite a common thing right




238
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,800
## now and i was just thinking about it




239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
## earlier about what kind of an example




240
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,199
## could i give




241
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,360
## you know to uh like i don't know an




242
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,400
## analogy to give




243
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
## and um it's kind of funny i don't know




244
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,520
## if you'll agree with me but




245
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,599
## i feel like av has become kind of like




246
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,640
## the nickelback




247
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,760
## of animal rights it's like




248
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,519
## i'm sorry i'm sorry but nickelback are




249
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,120
## extremely successful all right




250
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,800
## we've won so many awards end this stream




251
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,080
## nickelback has won loads of awards they




252
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
## play loads of gigs




253
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,800
## they were successful they got loads of




254
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
## fans but it's also very




255
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,160
## in to hate them it's almost like a trend




256
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,959
## to hate them




257
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,800
## right and that's what i'm kind of




258
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
## getting at here is that it's not a




259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
## surprise to me that




260
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
## someone is holding really negative




261
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
## opinions without even




262
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,160
## considering what you're doing because




263
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,680
## that's the in thing to do that's the




264
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
## kind of point i was making it seems cool




265
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
## like when i put out some messages asking




266
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,600
## people hey you know give me some




267
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
## questions for av




268
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
## i had a few people just replying just




269
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
## just with some you know




270
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
## real virtue signaling stuff like just




271
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,120
## really like just explaining why they




272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
## won't go for av anymore and i'm like




273
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,959
## that's great but like give me a question




274
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,399
## like give me something you know it just




275
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,000
## seems like it's cool to say

## i don't work with av i it seems cool to




277
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,920
## be like that like it's cool to say i




278

## hate nickelback




279
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
## i'm sorry to put you in that bracket but




280
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
## it really feels like that




281
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,519
## you know uh i've got to say and and that




282
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,800

## younger




289
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,200
## i have to admit i i i know it seems like
