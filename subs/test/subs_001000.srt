## into everything that's right here before us it 
## starts with us and then here on this planet we  




75
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
## want to try to find a home on mars and yet we 
## don't even know how to get things right here




76
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:22,560
## it makes no sense so that's my answer 
## to that all right so next question um




77
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,520
## um




78
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,840
## all right so




79
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,360

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,840
## both three hour cubes you're doing 
## two for international cube day awesome




81
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,320
## cool a question here about whether it has 
## started or not we are about to get started  




82
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:13,840
## i'm taking some questions just to get this started 
## and then we're going to get into the meat of this




83
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,880
## uh much love sylvia thank you for the support




84
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
## and thank you for representing us




85
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,200
## how to talk to a parent or turn how to talk to 
## a parent to turn them vegan if he or she doesn't  




86
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,160
## want to hear about animal suffering anytime 
## i try to talk about he she walks out of the  




87
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:48,640
## room and hangs up the phone etc agatha aguita's 
## question regarding parents it's no different to  




88
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,000
## talking to anybody else you hold human beings 
## accountable for the evils they commit against  




89
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,800
## non-human animals whether they're family or 
## friends doesn't matter because they're guilty just  




90
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:08,160
## the same as anybody else the thing with family is 
## you obviously have more of an affinity with family  




91
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:18,640
## and that means that you should give them more 
## patience more effort more of an explanation more  




92
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:29,600
## not an explanation it's just more time more time 
## but at a certain point you have to say to yourself  




93
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:39,120
## i have done my best and they aren't open 
## and willing to end their human supremacy




94
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,640
## and i know it's a hard road to walk but it's the 
## truth and i have dedicated myself to truth on this  




95
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,760
## planet i want my life to be dedicated to that and 
## nothing else so so that comes first i'm a human  




96
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:06,000
## being dedicated to truth before i am a human being 
## that belongs to a family does that make sense  




97
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,320
## um i also do think that family could be 
## one of the biggest downfalls of society




98
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
## but i'm not going to get into that all 
## right so moving on another question here  




99
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,600
## about overpopulation i'm just going 
## to quickly answer this but this is  




100
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,280
## going to be the last question i answer 
## before we get started and i want to  




101
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,280
## thank you for your patience guys all 
## right so the next question here is




102
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,280
## when we've solved the overpopulation of pet 
## animal issue do you think that we can still have  




103
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,680
## companion animals but create a solution when none 
## die in shelters yeah absolutely like sanctuaries  




104
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,840
## all of these shelters should be turned 
## into sanctuaries instead of a kill business




105
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,520
## all right i'm going to get started 
## now guys thanks for your patience so  




106
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,840
## i'm going to share my screen i'm going to 
## need your feedback in the comments so please  




107

## about the video and the audio
