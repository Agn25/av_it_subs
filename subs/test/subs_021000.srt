02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:07,600
## i just want to make sure that i 
## cover everything for you guys and  




1212
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:13,840
## i appreciate you guys being a part of 
## this live stream all right moving on




1213
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:21,680
## this approach is pure honesty telling someone the 
## truth is the most respectful thing you can do for  




1214
02:10:21,680 --> 02:10:29,040
## them when you agree with every statement said by 
## the bystander they will often lose respect for you  




1215
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:35,600
## and you will lose respect so you will lose control 
## of the conversation they see that your desire to  




1216
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:41,760
## be validated by them is stronger than your desire 
## to end animal cruelty thereby making a mockery of  




1217
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:47,440
## animal rights this one needs to be repeated 
## they see that your desire to be validated by  




1218
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:56,000
## them is stronger than your desire to end animal 
## cruelty thereby making a mockery of animal rights  




1219
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,400
## you imagine if the primary goal of human rights 
## activists was to be liked by the oppressors




1220
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:09,840
## 30 seconds




1221
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,080
## all right that's 30 seconds i'm liking 
## the 30 seconds it feels like the right  




1222
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:41,280
## amount of time here moving on




1223
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:49,360
## whenever you are afraid to speak up for animals 
## directly or if bystanders call you too extreme  




1224
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:56,160
## place yourself in the victim's position and 
## analyze your approach from their perspective would  




1225
02:11:56,160 --> 02:12:02,320
## you consider a respectful yet direct conversation 
## too extreme if you were locked in a slaughterhouse  




1226
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:08,800
## and that's the thing you know we are being 
## respectful here it's the most respect you'll  




1227
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:12,800
## ever show someone because you're telling 
## the truth and giving them a true opportunity  




1228
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:21,360
## to end their hypocrisy and to stop 
## abusing innocent beings like a psychopath




1229
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,760
## like a cold-blooded monster 
## that's what these people  




1230
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:33,840
## are especially once they know about what is 
## going on and they continue to do it right  




1231
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:41,760
## um i forgot to press start on the 30 seconds 
## so let's just say we're up to 15 seconds now




1232
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:55,120
## yes honesty is the highest form of intimacy this 
## might be irritating to some but it may not stop us  




1233
02:12:55,120 --> 02:13:00,480
## from telling the truth that's beautiful 
## yeah that's so true honesty is the  




1234
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:18,400
## highest form of intimacy word all right 
## moving on guys all right so next slide  




1235
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:25,360
## don't talk about health and environment 
## why do we think people care about either  




1236
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:29,360
## most people in the streets do not care 
## about their health nor the environment  




1237
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:37,360
## so rooting your outreach in these topics will 
## marginalize the animals even further health and  




1238
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:44,480
## environment may become have become exacerbated 
## because people do not take animal abuse seriously




1239
02:13:46,720 --> 02:13:50,320
## um again i need to repeat this 
## point because this is really  




1240
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:56,720
## powerful to know and understand that these 
## crisis that we're facing that we're facing  




1241
02:13:56,720 --> 02:14:00,080
## that we're facing with our 
## environment and our health  




1242
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:11,840
## is just an indication merely a a sign that's all 
## it is of how bad animal abuse is on this planet




1243
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:21,280
## again i was supposed to press start there 
## um oh no i haven't finished this all right  




1244
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:27,840
## um the last point trying to hook people with 
## an approach that revolves around what benefits  




1245
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:34,240
## them does not let me start again trying to hook 
## people with an approach that revolves around what  




1246
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:38,400
## that revolves around what benefits 
## them does a disservice to the animals  




1247
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:42,160
## focus on the root cause of 
## the issue the animal abuse




1248
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:50,160
## i kind of stumbled through that one but you 
## get the point you can see it i'm going to  




1249
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:54,960
## start this 30 seconds if you guys have anything 
## you'd like me to expand on here let me know




1250
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:02,240
## people say this is fake that it's not 
## true what to say just point at the screens
