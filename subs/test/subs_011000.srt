01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:06,800
## eat less now i'm just going to leave you with 
## this to think about because you said try would  




648
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,240
## we say that with any other injustice would we try 
## to not be a child abuser or would we just do it




649
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:20,480
## yeah so please don't compromise on this injustice 
## because the animals suffer as a result of that  




650
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,800
## you really just need to get out there and do 
## this and see how effective it is for yourself  




651
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:33,920
## that one guy he was talking to so anyone 
## can do this and i highly recommend it and  




652
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:41,120
## the tallies as you know we've removed our tallies 
## we used to try and measure how effective we are  




653
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:46,800
## and that was the reason why we had the tally 
## there we tried to have some kind of metric  




654
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:53,600
## that we wanted to use to show that these events 
## this form of street outreach is really effective  




655
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,240
## but the mistake that we made is that you can't 
## really tell if someone is going to go vegan or not  




656
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:03,120
## you just have to speak for the animals in 
## the way that you would want to be spoken for  




657
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:09,760
## if you're in their position say the correct 
## things and that's a successful conversation and  




658
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,760
## a lot of the times people say they're going to 
## go vegan and while that's still a good thing i'm  




659
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,520
## not saying that's not a good indication if someone 
## says they're going to go vegan they may very well  




660
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,560
## stick to that but i actually have examples of many 
## cases of people saying they're going vegan after  




661
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:33,760
## listening to me and they do not go vegan you don't 
## know what's going on in people's minds and what's  




662
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,160
## going on in their hearts and what they're going 
## to experience after they've talked to you you  




663
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,200
## don't know if they're going to continue arguing 
## with their friends about what you've talked to  




664
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:47,040
## them about and then that leading to them going 
## vegan because all of their friends made stupid  




665
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:52,560
## comments and one of their friend held them to 
## account again and that rang in their head and  




666
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,360
## they were thinking about it for a week and they 
## couldn't let it go and then finally they conceded  




667
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,760
## to the hypocrisy and they became vegan you 
## just don't know you don't know the process  




668
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:08,320
## another thing is that hypocrisy i just want to 
## go back to that real quick it's the reason why  




669
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,000
## each of us went vegan for sure there's a story 
## that i have on my youtube of gary yourofsky  




670
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,240
## i was in the car with him he was 
## telling this really awesome story that




671
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:28,000
## all right okay guys i want you to pay attention 
## to this point i'm making here because i only  




672
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,160
## realized how powerful and significant this 
## point was when i watched this workshop back  




673
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:42,320
## what i have successfully pointed out here 
## is well you'll hear my point in a moment but  




674
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:49,200
## this is so tremendously profound and i really want 
## you to understand what i'm saying here but it's a  




675
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:55,360
## story about gary and i haven't even pointed this 
## out to gary yet but i'm going to do so soon but  




676
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:01,520
## one thing i learned from him is that he didn't go 
## vegan because of that elephant in the circus and  




677
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,760
## he didn't go vegan because of the pigs that he saw 
## being tortured and murdered at thorn apple valley  




678
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:13,520
## um pig pig slaughterhouse the pig sloth house 
## there so that's the story he's told the world  




679
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:19,840
## and i believe that that's what he felt was 
## the catalyst for a long time but when i was  




680
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:26,240
## chilling with him in detroit he told me a story 
## which i recorded and i put up on my youtube  




681
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:35,280
## and that story he tells a new story about how he 
## went vegan and what was really the catalyst to  




682
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:43,280
## change him and it's really powerful if you want 
## to understand what it takes to truly get people  




683
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,640
## to go vegan because if we can understand how 
## the best activists in the world have gone vegan  




684
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,040
## then that's a pretty good indicator because that's 
## what we're trying to shoot for here not just  




685
01:13:53,040 --> 01:14:00,320
## people to go vegan but we need people to speak up 
## and to be effective when they speak up and let's  




686
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,360
## look at how activists went vegan that's a great 
## thing to observe and learn from so without further  




687
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:12,720
## ado please pay attention one of their friend held 
## them to account again and that rang in their head  




688
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:17,040
## and they were thinking about it for a week and 
## they couldn't let it go and then finally they  




689
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:22,000
## conceded to the hypocrisy and they became vegan 
## you just don't know you don't know the process  




690
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:28,560
## another thing is that hypocrisy i just want to 
## go back to that real quick it's the reason why  




691
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:34,320
## each of us went vegan for sure there's a story 
## that i have on my youtube of gary yourofsky  




692
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:39,920
## i was in the car with him he was telling this 
## really awesome story that i'd never heard before  




693
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:47,920
## about how a hockey team in detroit used to throw 
## octopuses onto the ice and he was an animal rights  




694
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:52,560
## guy at the time every time someone would score 
## a goal they would do this and he was an animal  




695
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,440
## rights guy at the time who was protesting this 
## and he called a radio station and he started  




696
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,520
## saying what's next are we going to have all these 
## other teams with sharks and lions and their names
