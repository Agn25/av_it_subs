3437
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:07,040
## did admit to doing this himself um so




3438
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:10,080
## it's not just an opinion that we had




3439
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,719
## this was really happening and that that




3440
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:13,920
## was the issue that you're pointing out




3441
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,599
## david




3442
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:18,320
## sure and and george and another




3443
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:19,520
## individual they were




3444
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,880
## removed from the team was was that




3445
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,199
## because of this specific example or was




3446
01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:24,159
## there another reason that these




3447
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:26,159
## individuals were removed




3448
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:27,360
## there was another question somebody




3449
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:30,320
## asked that was one of the comments




3450
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:33,920
## but there were other comments left




3451
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,880
## um by george but also it was the




3452
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,960
## conversations we had in private with




3453
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:39,280
## them




3454
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,760
## about the issue i believe the comments




3455
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:43,119
## were about




3456
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:45,599
## um denying that systemic oppression




3457
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:47,119
## exists




3458
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:49,840
## and how that comment was left by our




3459
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,679
## social media




3460
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:55,199
## members without them running it by us




3461
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:59,679
## and that's not something that um




3462
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:02,480
## just didn't align with us or av or other




3463
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:04,239
## team members so that's why




3464
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:06,480
## we had to have private conversations to




3465
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,719
## clarify this and that




3466
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:10,080
## and during those conversations we




3467
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,560
## realized that we're just not aligned




3468
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,639
## and it was just not possible at that




3469
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:17,280
## point to have them on the team




3470
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,760
## yeah just to clarify yeah because it




3471
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,360
## might be confused by people




3472
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,080
## in what we're saying here uh that like




3473
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,679
## gemma and george were




3474
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,920
## like fired on the same premise they




3475
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,159
## weren't removed from av




3476
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:31,520
## on the same premise there was a




3477
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,000
## different uh scenario for those both




3478
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,199
## individuals like we




3479
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:37,679
## a different decision process for both




3480
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,199
## those individuals there were different




3481
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:40,800
## things that occurred with george as well




3482
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,800
## it wasn't just one thing it wasn't one




3483
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:43,520
## comment




3484
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,239
## or one point multiple comments and then




3485
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:48,239
## multiple conversations that we were




3486
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,000
## having that




3487
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
## made it clear that yeah but it was




3488
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,040
## different




3489
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,119
## and and it wasn't just this no i was




3490
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:57,520
## like another example was about




3491
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,080
## how because the comment that you just




3492
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,000
## read out i didn't remember that one but




3493
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,679
## i know there was another one




3494
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:08,000
## going around what our team said




3495
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,040
## systemic oppression doesn't exist in the




3496
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,880
## west or something like that which




3497
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,119
## we were getting lots of messages about




3498
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:17,119
## and so i do remember that very clearly




3499
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:18,400
## right there were i think there were




3500
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,520
## multiple things




3501
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:21,920
## otherwise we wouldn't just ask someone




3502
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,360
## to leave the team over one




3503
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,760
## comment especially someone who was an




3504
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,119
## asset to the organization




3505
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:30,560
## george was a prized member of the team




3506
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,520
## whom i really liked working with and i




3507
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:34,719
## thought that he was a great




3508
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:38,719
## member so it's ridiculous that we would




3509
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:40,560
## um yeah it's tough to be in this




3510
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,880
## position um




3511
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,159
## you know that's the thing also like




3512
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:49,440
## it sucks to have to fire someone like




3513
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,639
## george yeah i just want to add because




3514
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:54,080
## it's okay to have




3515
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,320
## your own political views your religious




3516
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,280
## views




3517
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,960
## but if you are commenting as a v




3518
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,920
## as a part of the team and then those




3519
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,040
## views are coming




3520
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,440
## through your comments and your messages




3521
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,880
## then that's not okay




3522
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,880
## because within the team like i said we




3523
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,960
## have over 20 people or something




3524
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:15,360
## and we all have different views and then




3525
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,599
## we have our own political views or our




3526
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:18,320
## own




3527
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,119
## views on god or religion or whatever but




3528
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:22,239
## you never see us




3529
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:23,760
## commenting about it when we're




3530
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,760
## commenting as a v because




3531
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:28,560
## av is supposed to represent something




3532
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,080
## that is just about the animal so




3533
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,920
## regardless of your views you can be a




3534
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:33,199
## part of that and




3535
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:35,360
## that was the issue that it was just not




3536
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:37,679
## possible to




3537
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,599
## to have that with those individuals and




3538
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,119
## people don't seem to be




3539
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:44,239
## wanting to work with us to create




3540
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:47,440
## the most conducive organization




3541
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,119
## that is dedicated to the animals




3542
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:52,800
## people don't seem to be working with us




3543
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,159
## to achieve this




3544
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:55,840
## we seem to be dedicated to it and




3545
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,360
## everyone seems to be pushing back and




3546
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:00,719
## pushing back and pushing back




3547
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:03,679
## we are open to ideas we want to see how




3548
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:04,880
## we can help




3549
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:07,920
## other like other things here but




3550
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,760
## we have like us i was saying we have




3551
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,440
## other people in the organization




3552
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,599
## who have even stronger political views




3553
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:14,480
## than george do




3554
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:17,760
## than george does even stronger political




3555
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,599
## views than than george does




3556
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:23,440
## think i mean think about that you know




3557
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:27,440
## yeah sure and they don't they don't ever




3558
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:29,199
## they never let their advisors come




3559
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:30,800
## through their work




3560
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,080
## so that's but again when it's not to




3561
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,679
## focus on just one point here because it




3562
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:37,360
## wasn't just one a one-dimensional




3563
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:38,159
## decision




3564
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:41,679
## it was multi-dimensional and that that's




3565
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:43,360
## also kind of entwined with the uh




3566
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,159
## intertwined the




3567
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:46,639
## with another kind of criticism i had




3568
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:47,199
## about the




3569
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:49,520
## comments like uh there were i don't know




3570
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,119
## if there still are i haven't seen any




3571
01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:52,320
## since this but




3572
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,480
## there were quite a lot of let's say rude




3573
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,520
## comments




3574
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,480
## um on on the av social media let's say




3575
01:59:58,480 --> 01:59:58,960
## like




3576
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,679
## sometimes i think i even saw one someone
