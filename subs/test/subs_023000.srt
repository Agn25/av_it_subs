02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:07,680
## and the way that they try to make vegans think 
## that plants have feelings for example like they  




1378
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:12,800
## really get deep into it and they're like yeah 
## like they feel stuff and like yeah they're like  




1379
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:23,200
## they act like they really believe it but it's 
## just their cunningness is a lie it's really  




1380
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:30,479
## their guilt trying to double down you know so um 
## are there any questions here i'm not even going  




1381
02:30:30,479 --> 02:30:34,879
## to do the 30 seconds thing because i've given 
## you guys plenty of time while i've been talking




1382
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:46,160
## yes it does stay online afterwards malia 
## this will be available online once i'm done




1383
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:56,479
## you can tell by their body language when they're 
## not even looking at the footage because they're  




1384
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:03,600
## only there to waste our time yeah if they don't 
## want to be there just get them to go just go




1385
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:13,840
## indirect distractions and so on yes exactly 
## indirect distractions that's what it is




1386
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:27,760
## all right moving on guys it doesn't seem like 
## you guys want me to expand on much here so i  




1387
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:34,080
## might even just keep this moving at a quicker 
## pace activism is not sales sales training does  




1388
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:42,080
## not equal good activism using slick talk to trick 
## people into veganism doesn't work your job is to  




1389
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:49,920
## hold the bystander accountable it's up to them 
## which actions they take initially av made too  




1390
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:56,560
## strong of a connection between sales and activism 
## tools taught in sales training only go so far  




1391
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:02,880
## any questions about this or anything you 
## want me to expand on it 30 seconds but




1392
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:10,479
## [ __ ] i might even reduce this 
## down even further 10 seconds




1393
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:14,880
## now i'll keep it at 30 seconds but uh




1394
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:26,000
## let me let me know guys if you want me to break 
## anything down further for you five seconds




1395
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:38,400
## moving on so the next slide activism is not 
## sales we're still continuing on this thing




1396
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:44,800
## a successful conversation is not one 
## where the bystander says i'm going vegan  




1397
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:51,440
## that's not necessarily the thing that you should 
## be looking for it's where you say the right things  




1398
02:32:51,439 --> 02:32:57,200
## most people become vegan after they hear the truth 
## from us how long it takes is up to the individual




1399
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:00,160
## 30 seconds




1400
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:11,280
## okay so uh there's a question here i'm you're 
## still confused about the sales thing could you  




1401
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:19,840
## give me an example or more could you be more 
## specific about what you're confused about




1402
02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:29,200
## good question summer do you still promote feel 
## felt found i never really understood what that  




1403
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:36,240
## means again that was just a communication tool i 
## thought it would be helpful i don't use it anymore  




1404
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:43,040
## and it's not in this outreach workshop for a 
## reason that you have pointed out and i appreciate  




1405
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:48,640
## that we've removed it because again we make too 
## strong of a connection to sales and i don't want  




1406
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:55,680
## people to think that these communication tools are 
## the approach like this is that's not an approach  




1407
02:33:57,280 --> 02:34:02,639
## that's just a tool a little tiny little tool 
## that can help with your communication but feel  




1408
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:09,281
## fat found no you don't really need to use 
## that and we've removed it it's unnecessary




1409
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:19,040
## what you said about giving fair warning 
## before asking a question or commenting  




1410
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:26,479
## is a good way to proceed awesome like 
## how do we know if we've made an impact  




1411
02:34:26,479 --> 02:34:32,160
## on their perception apart from their 
## guilt you don't uh you well you don't  




1412
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:39,359
## there are certain indicators but like we say here 
## most people become vegan after they hear the truth  




1413
02:34:39,359 --> 02:34:47,759
## from us how long it takes is up to the individual 
## and that's why i say i want you to connect to this  




1414
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:54,960
## approach in in i want you to connect to 
## understanding that if you say the right things  




1415
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:59,359
## on behalf of the victims then you have succeeded 
## in your outreach because that's the best you can  




1416
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:11,839
## do the next step is physically forcing people 
## to become vegan which we can't do does that help
