451
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,839
## is the actual interaction so this is the




452
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,360
## individual




453
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
## saying the information requested is




454
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
## pretty standard for an audit so this is




455
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
## correct this is what she said




456
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
## no lies there okay that's in line with




457
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,279
## the message i received




458
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
## so here's paul being extremely




459
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,639
## aggressive apparently




460
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,399
## i don't know now requests bank login




461
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,680
## details to be handled




462
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,199
## handed over to a non-accountant and a




463
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
## former gang member how is that stuck




464
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
## that's how stock standard audit is




465
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
## carried out is it so




466
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,079
## that's the aggressive response




467
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,480
## apparently um this person responds




468
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,040
## saying




469
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
## you know she's upset because the it's




470
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
## calling joey a former gang member




471
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,639
## um and saying that screenshots could be




472
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,240
## manipulated and then




473
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
## paul goes to justify himself saying well




474
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,440
## joey calls himself




475
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,160
## an ex-gang member um okay so not not




476
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,680
## nothing really going on there no [ __ ]




477
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
## off nothing like that so far




478
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,480
## and it goes on you're thinking okay so




479
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,839
## where is the [ __ ] off coming where's the




480
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,800
## [ __ ] off and leave




481
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,160
## part coming right because that's the




482
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
## main part here that sounds horrible the




483
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
## aggressive [ __ ] off and leave




484
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,040
## um all we've got here is paul saying get




485
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,920
## out of here




486
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,199
## you said get out of here so let's not




487
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
## [ __ ] off and leave and then




488
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,320
## this person who was an organizer gets




489
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
## out of there she decides to leave




490
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
## and that's it that's it that's the whole




491
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,759
## interaction




492
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,160
## yeah can i just pause you there yeah go




493
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,040
## ahead




494
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
## uh so at this point i didn't even know




495
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,160
## that she was an organizer that's why she




496
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
## says in the next comment oh no paul




497
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
## bless you i am one of your organizers so




498
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
## she's now informed me of this




499
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,720
## after you said get out of here yeah so




500
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
## after




501
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
## the uh fact but yeah




502
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
## just that's it's okay yeah and that




503
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
## that's exactly it's even




504
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,839
## this is my point basically when i was




505
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,199
## talking about the whole nickelback thing




506
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:43,839
## and




507
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,160
## how these rumors get spread and it's




508
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,079
## cool to hate av it's because of things




509
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,040
## like this




510
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
## don't get me wrong i know there are




511
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,639
## examples out there of me




512
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,560
## being an [ __ ] to people and i'm sure




513
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,839
## there are examples out there of you guys




514
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,199
## being an [ __ ] to people




515
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,440
## but to go and actually take something




516
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,560
## that didn't happen




517
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
## and get it into your head that it




518
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
## happened a certain way where you know




519
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,520
## you were told to [ __ ] off and leave as




520
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,119
## an organizer and




521
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
## you know people believe this and this




522
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,799
## goes and goes and goes and i guess my




523
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,160
## question for you is




524
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,679
## how does this happen how do we get to




525
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,919
## the point now where we have people that




526
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,000
## believe that they have been wronged by




527
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
## you they believe it so much




528
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,199
## that they go and tell other people they




529
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,640
## were wronged by you that they were told




530
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,520
## to [ __ ] off




531
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
## when there is literal evidence that you




532
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,599
## have obviously and it's online




533
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,919
## to show that this is not how it went why




534
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,720
## does it happen




535
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
## and why do people believe it instantly




536
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,720
## without even




537
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,960
## checking or questioning it like how did




538
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,679
## we get to this point in your opinion




539
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
## it's for the same reason that you get




540
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,799
## hate when




541
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,160
## people choose to run




542
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,360
## hate campaign small or large against you




543
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,240
## and their baseless claims it's the same




544
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,360
## reason that




545
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,320
## anyone of any amount of influence in




546
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,200
## this day and age in this




547
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,799
## age of outrage you know in this council




548
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,080
## council culture this is the way that it




549
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
## works right people don't




550
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,280
## work off people don't




551
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,240
## have standards for information anymore




552
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,720
## then




553
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,919
## they don't hear something and then




554
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
## screen it they hear something and they




555
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
## say well he said it with conviction or




556
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,799
## she said it with conviction




557
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,320
## or they said it with conviction and




558
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,880
## therefore it must be true and if they




559
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,320
## said it in the comments section of a




560
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,360
## post with emotion




561
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
## it's true it doesn't you don't need to




562
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
## do any more homework than that so




563
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
## i guess that question is a bit more




564
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
## deeper it's




565
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,960
## it's it's more of a question about why




566
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,000
## humans are the way




567
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,919
## humans are yeah




568
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,240
## yeah and and yeah i can see so you think




569
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,880
## you you're putting it down to the




570
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,600
## the more the popularity aspect of it in




571
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,799
## that like the more




572
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,039
## the more well-known an individual or a




573
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,039
## group is the more of this that's going




574
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,440
## to come




575
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,559
## is that is that am i right and




576
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,120
## understanding this is kind of the point




577
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,960
## yeah and you know a lot of our




578
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
## organizers have had




579
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,360
## challenges in dealing with hate that




580
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
## they get when they come on to




581
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,799
## become an organizer and represent




582
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,000
## av in their cities because they're seen




583
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,799
## as like




584
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,080
## working for hitler you know right




585
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,960
## and yeah you know we we tell organizers




586
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,160
## one of the things you learn




587
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,039
## about being a human rights activist when




588
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,440
## you




589
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,720
## work with us is dealing with that [ __ ]




590
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,480
## right and that's part of it if you want




591
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,840
## to




592
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
## do something of influence within this




593
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,480
## world and make an impact




594
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,600
## i i i agree




595
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,080
## so um let's yeah i think i think that's




596
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
## a that's going to be a recurring topic




597
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,640
## to be honest with you so
