3282
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:00,560
## been




3283
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,320
## communicated better um and that's why




3284
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,239
## before we removed it we actually went in




3285
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:08,159
## and edited the post a little bit so we




3286
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:10,800
## changed the wording in certain parts




3287
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,239
## um so that there was more




3288
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:16,800
## empathy or you know it didn't come




3289
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,320
## across as insensitive




3290
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,840
## like you said but absolutely no




3291
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,239
## it wasn't yes so i think i think that's




3292
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:25,119
## that's a




3293
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,719
## a wider issue really isn't it




3294
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:28,480
## insensitivity versus




3295
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:31,599
## uh versus racism or or whatever ism you




3296
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:33,360
## want to attach it's uh




3297
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:36,080
## it's not bigoted to be insensitive um




3298
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:36,639
## it's




3299
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:39,040
## some people are i don't know harsher




3300
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,000
## than others




3301
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,800
## and i think um on a personal level i




3302
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,480
## think i think that's




3303
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,920
## where a lot of the criticisms and




3304
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,599
## accusations come from with av




3305
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:50,800
## i don't think it's uh i think it is that




3306
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,880
## our movement is quite a sensitive




3307
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:55,360
## movement with very sensitive people and




3308
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:59,119
## av isn't isn't very sensitive and that's




3309
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:00,080
## that's not i don't mean that as a




3310
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,239
## criticism at all i mean that as in




3311
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:03,920
## some people don't like that and that's




3312
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,440
## that's you know that's where we get a




3313
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,400
## lot of




3314
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,920
## a lot of people who come up and speak up




3315
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,599
## about it whereas if you look at an




3316
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:11,360
## organization like save for example




3317
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,880
## they're the complete opposite side




3318
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,560
## they're extremely sensitive




3319
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,400
## and so they attract a lot of people who




3320
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,880
## are uh you know also extremely sensitive




3321
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,000
## which happens to be




3322
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,159
## the vast majority of of the animal




3323
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,760
## rights movement and




3324
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,840
## the vegan movement people tend to be




3325
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,280
## very sensitive




3326
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,520
## in these groups so you know i can see i




3327
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,800
## can see where the accusations come




3328
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,360
## flying in from but um




3329
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,719
## i think if they were accusing you of




3330
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:37,440
## insensitivity and and being too mean




3331
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,840
## i think that would probably be not as




3332
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,440
## nowhere near as harmful as




3333
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,400
## throwing the word racist at every turn




3334
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,679
## you know




3335
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:47,520
## that's my observation anyway that's what




3336
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,560
## i'm observing from the outside




3337
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:51,920
## and this kind of track this this




3338
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,760
## continues really with the social media




3339
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:54,320
## people




3340
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,159
## have been upset by your social media




3341
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:57,440
## quite a lot and i know some of these




3342
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,719
## examples are going to be very easy to




3343
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,080
## discuss but we'll start off with the




3344
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,440
## most difficult one




3345
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,480
## just to uh kick it off with this um




3346
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:07,280
## i want to discuss the whole uh the whole




3347
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,400
## hitler thing




3348
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,480
## and george because a few people asked me




3349
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:11,920
## about this they asked me about george




3350
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,599
## they asked me about this post this




3351
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:15,199
## this uh which obviously i know you




3352
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:16,639
## removed it um




3353
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:19,040
## but they kind of want to know how it got




3354
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,159
## to the point where




3355
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:22,400
## someone in the organization would think




3356
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,599
## about making a post




3357
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,040
## a comment like that and kind of what you




3358
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,119
## guys think about it so




3359
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:28,800
## if again for those who don't know there




3360
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,239
## was the um




3361
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:31,760
## there was a post made i believe it was




3362
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,760
## it was avs page as well wasn't it on




3363
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,360
## facebook it was a comment




3364
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,760
## um where the comment was talking about




3365
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:38,400
## hitler




3366
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,199
## and it was comparing hitler and the it




3367
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:43,040
## was saying basically




3368
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,400
## out of context here by the way




3369
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,840
## completely out of context and i've not




3370
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,119
## got the screen shot so i'm not going to




3371
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:48,880
## put it up but out of out of context it




3372
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,320
## was making a comparison




3373
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,719
## and saying that the holocaust that




3374
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:53,679
## hitler did




3375
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:56,800
## had more justification than the




3376
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,040
## holocaust of the animals i'm




3377
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,800
## paraphrasing here it was put into a




3378
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,239
## better context than that but that's




3379
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,000
## that was the takeaway message that it




3380
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
## was it had more justification because a




3381
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,040
## book was written about




3382
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,280
## it practically or have i missed a big




3383
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,639
## point there but either way




3384
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:12,400
## that seemed to be the take away point




3385
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,320
## from it um out of context and that was




3386
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,760
## obviously posted by




3387
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,599
## i believe george in the in the




3388
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:19,760
## organization on as av




3389
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,679
## so like what happened with this have i




3390
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:22,960
## got that wrong have people got that




3391
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:23,360
## wrong




3392
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,520
## and




3393
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,040
## he's not saying that he wasn't saying




3394
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:32,480
## like legitimate justifications were




3395
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:35,840
## were afoot in those cases he was saying




3396
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:36,560
## that




3397
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,639
## more reasons were provided by hitler and




3398
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:40,800
## his regime uh




3399
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,280
## to the public then then the re then then




3400
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,719
## what non-vegans offer




3401
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:46,960
## to the public regarding the injustice




3402
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,000
## that they're involved in that's what he




3403
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:48,719
## was saying




3404
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:53,360
## but the way that he said it lacked eq




3405
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,520
## you got to have iq george is a smart guy




3406
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,360
## but you got to have eq2 you got to read




3407
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,280
## the room and not be an idiot about how




3408
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,119
## you communicate emotionally




3409
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:03,119
## uh so that's the thing it wasn't clear




3410
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:05,040
## enough the communication we identified




3411
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,239
## as something that needs to be improved




3412
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:07,599
## and that's why we




3413
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:10,719
## addressed the whole




3414
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:13,760
## blm post to begin with




3415
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,520
## uh the way that we did it was about the




3416
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,040
## communication




3417
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,199
## um and we still feel justified in




3418
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:20,239
## addressing




3419
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:22,320
## what we addressed and we will continue




3420
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:23,520
## to do so




3421
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:28,080
## but um i think you know sometimes




3422
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:31,920
## yeah the issue there was um




3423
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,840
## sometimes there is bias that's brought




3424
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,679
## into the work




3425
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:40,400
## that people are doing within ab




3426
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,000
## they bring their own biases whether




3427
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,520
## they're political or




3428
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,840
## otherwise in the way that they




3429
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:46,639
## communicate




3430
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:49,360
## and people need to remember if they're




3431
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,360
## working with av they're representing ap




3432
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,000
## just like




3433
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
## with any other org or group that they're




3434
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,119
## working with




3435
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:59,679
## and when you're representing us




3436
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:03,199
## we don't want that and you know he also
