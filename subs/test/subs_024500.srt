02:45:06,960 --> 02:45:13,840
## hmm




1495
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:18,320
## moving on




1496
02:45:22,399 --> 02:45:26,319
## we're nearly nearly finished 
## with these slides also guys  




1497
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:30,799
## typical outreach structure ask them do 
## they think it's possible to be against  




1498
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:34,160
## animal abuse while demanding 
## products like meat dairy and eggs




1499
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:43,200
## i don't think we covered this in the uh 
## presentation but this is a powerful point  




1500
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:47,679
## i'm going to read it again ask them do you 
## think it's possible to be against animal  




1501
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:55,040
## abuse while demanding products like meat dairy 
## and eggs ask them what is stopping them from  




1502
02:45:55,040 --> 02:46:01,120
## not abusing animals and being vegan what 
## do you feel like would be stopping you from  




1503
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:09,840
## not abusing animals and being vegan this 
## will lead to their objections 30 seconds




1504
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:18,559
## how to respond if they 
## don't consider those footage  




1505
02:46:20,319 --> 02:46:25,439
## wow let me read this question out um how to 
## respond if people don't consider the footage  




1506
02:46:25,439 --> 02:46:31,359
## to be animal abuse you have no conversation to be 
## having with that person move on to the next person  




1507
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:44,480
## if blood flying everywhere and heads being cut 
## off is not animal abuse if baby male chicks if  




1508
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:52,799
## baby chicks are being grinded alive in a big 
## blender and they don't think that's animal abuse




1509
02:46:55,439 --> 02:47:02,319
## you're not talking to a rational person so i would 
## say you need to move on to the next person jezebel




1510
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:09,440
## if they say they don't care about animal 
## abuse is it best just to end the conversation  




1511
02:47:10,319 --> 02:47:18,719
## i would say what if you were the one being 
## abused would you care then or it's easy to  




1512
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:24,960
## say when you're the abuser what if you were the 
## one being abused that's the upgrade there for you




1513
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:32,800
## and then move on if it goes 
## downhill from there because  




1514
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:36,640
## this is not a rational open and 
## willing person you're speaking to




1515
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:48,319
## carlo recently you said in a video 
## we have to avoid the word vegan i'm  




1516
02:47:48,319 --> 02:47:53,439
## a little confused about it now so you suggest 
## to openly say we are promoting veganism or not  




1517
02:47:54,399 --> 02:47:58,719
## i never said to not use the word vegan in 
## fact i say i said that i used the word vegan  




1518
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:06,000
## it's just what i'm saying carlo is that 
## it's far more effective for us to explain  




1519
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:10,720
## what the meaning like to say 
## human supremacy or animal abuse  




1520
02:48:11,439 --> 02:48:21,439
## you know to detail what it really means to be 
## vegan like if in this point um if i mean at  




1521
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:26,399
## this point in the conversation you're saying if 
## we are saying that we're promoting veganism um




1522
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:33,760
## this is it depends this is something that i would 
## say if someone says you're promoting vegetarianism  




1523
02:48:34,560 --> 02:48:38,480
## i would correct that and say we're not promoting 
## vegetarianism because that doesn't address the  




1524
02:48:38,479 --> 02:48:46,319
## issue at all we're promoting veganism so i would 
## not shy away from saying the word vegan however  




1525
02:48:46,319 --> 02:48:51,519
## it's usually best for you to talk about what that 
## word actually means than to just use the word  




1526
02:48:52,399 --> 02:48:58,240
## why because the word has a lot of confusion 
## around it within the animal rights movement  




1527
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:02,560
## you can see how there's so 
## many definitions flying around  




1528
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:05,920
## and that's why we started this with 
## the definition of veganism itself




1529
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:13,680
## even if they are killed quickly it is 
## still animal abuse of course because again  




1530
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:20,320
## if you were the victim it is still abuse to take 
## your life even if it's done quickly of course  




1531
02:49:20,319 --> 02:49:27,759
## you would see it as abuse in that circumstance you 
## know the jews who were killed in the concentration  




1532
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:31,840
## camps if they were gassed and killed quickly 
## that doesn't make the injustice any less worse




1533
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:47,279
## cool um moving on next slide objection handling 
## whenever a bystander brings up an objection  




1534
02:49:47,279 --> 02:49:51,200
## place them in the victim's position 
## and allow them to analyze the objection  




1535
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:56,399
## from that perspective every single time 
## this happens the objection will fall apart  




1536
02:49:57,520 --> 02:50:03,440
## most objections are easy and quick to respond 
## to some are more nuanced and require a deeper
