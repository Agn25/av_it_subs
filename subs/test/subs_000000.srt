## to the next thing great all right so yeah we're 
## in lockdown here in australia and currently uh  




23
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,040
## we can only assemble 10 people max in a 
## public area and so given that restriction  




24
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,040
## it's going to be really difficult for 
## any cubes to happen i'm going to be doing  




25
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:47,760
## a limited attendance cube in melbourne 
## tomorrow we'll see how we go with that but  




26
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,320
## yeah because of the restrictions around 
## the world we only have um 170 odd  




27
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,640
## uh almost up to 200 i think i haven't even checked 
## the figures over the last couple of days but  




28
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,800
## yeah i uh i had a look at the figures last 
## and was impressed that we have almost 200  




29
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,840
## events scheduled given the 
## restrictions that we have so  




30
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,040
## yeah last year we had 500 cubes scheduled 
## around the world and as you may or may not  




31
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,800
## know international cube day is the biggest day of 
## the year for us because it's our biggest campaign  




32
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,440
## and the essence of it in case you don't know is 
## to do as many cubes around the world as possible  




33
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,120
## so it's a fantastic time of the year for us 
## but given the restrictions it's a limited




34
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:41,840
## campaign




35
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,160
## all right what's up vegan king all right so 
## let's get into this we're gonna start off oh i

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,160
## need to send out a quick story to everybody on 
## instagram telling them that we are now live so
