1296
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:07,680
## don't get lost in these distractions compare 
## animal abuse to a comparable injustice to get  




1297
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:13,040
## you back on track and like i was saying earlier 
## on in this video the best injustice to compare to  




1298
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:19,600
## is the one that involves the individual you're 
## speaking to as the victim so if they imagine  




1299
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:25,121
## themselves as the victim of the injustice that 
## you're speaking about when you compare it that's  




1300
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:43,840
## going to be the best way for them to feel what 
## it is they need to feel in that moment 30 seconds




1301
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:48,399
## good night daniel thank you 
## for being a part of this man




1302
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:58,880
## uh i don't know who epa is david




1303
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:09,200
## all right we've done 30 seconds i 
## don't see anything you guys want me to  




1304
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:11,840
## expand on here so we're going to move on




1305
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:19,680
## all right moving on so the next 
## slide where we got to the 12th slide  




1306
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:28,400
## okay which injustices to compare to so i 
## actually break this last point i just made  




1307
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:33,040
## even further down in this slide it is most 
## effective to compare to injustices such as  




1308
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:38,960
## child abuse or human trafficking child abuse and 
## human trafficking are the most comparable human  




1309
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:46,319
## injustices that we've found to compare to the 
## most effective comparison to make is to place  




1310
02:21:46,319 --> 02:21:52,799
## the bystander in the victim's position i just 
## explained that but that's there for you again to  




1311
02:21:53,439 --> 02:21:58,639
## absorb i really want you to take that 
## into consideration and really absorb that  




1312
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:02,241
## avoid dog comparisons this goes 
## back to not leading with compassion  




1313
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:09,121
## it's not about the love people feel towards 
## animals it's about the hate they feel towards  




1314
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:17,120
## injustice and i would say injustice in their name 
## or because of them not in their name but because  




1315
02:22:17,120 --> 02:22:23,519
## of their actions right in their name is kind of an 
## ego thing it doesn't come down to whether you can  




1316
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:28,000
## imagine your dog in a slaughterhouse it comes 
## down to whether you can imagine yourself in a  




1317
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,640
## slaughterhouse right i'm going to repeat that it 
## doesn't come down to whether you can imagine your  




1318
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:38,320
## dog in a slaughterhouse it comes down to whether 
## you can imagine yourself in a slaughterhouse  




1319
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:49,840
## that's the truth that's what makes 
## you really wake up to this 30 seconds




1320
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:25,680
## yeah so carlo about the moralities 
## black and white you have to  




1321
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:31,840
## clarify that specifically we're talking 
## about injustices that involve victims  




1322
02:23:32,479 --> 02:23:38,559
## oppression these things are black and white 
## if it's needless and this is it needs to stop  




1323
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:43,600
## it's really simple you don't need to 
## necessarily say morality is black and white




1324
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:50,480
## i'm just pointing this out in this in 
## this workshop for you guys that you need  




1325
02:23:50,479 --> 02:23:56,160
## to understand morality is black and white and the 
## way that you communicate this to other people but  




1326
02:23:56,160 --> 02:24:02,000
## you don't necessarily need to say morality 
## is black and white in those words but yeah  




1327
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,520
## if people want to get into a philosophical 
## discussion you know just put an end to that




1328
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:14,160
## america's environmental protection agency is 
## the epa which is a broken government system  




1329
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:16,559
## uh yeah i wouldn't i don't have any interest




1330
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:33,680
## um okay yeah people just say they don't mind 
## eating dogs as well it happens so often yeah  




1331
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:39,360
## what about dogs yeah well if i had to eat a dog 
## i would it just immediately blows up in our face  




1332
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:50,399
## um and i'm talking about most of the time here dog 
## comparisons seemingly work niraj they seemingly  




1333
02:24:50,399 --> 02:24:58,319
## work because your indicator of an effective 
## conversation might be someone doing this uh-huh  




1334
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:07,040
## yes i agree yes uh-huh that's not necessarily 
## effective it's very easy to agree with things like
