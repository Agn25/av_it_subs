154
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,720
## so that's your role as an activist and it really 
## is that simple but if you ever get lost and you  




155
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,880
## are ever in doubt just remember you're 
## speaking for the animals in the same way you  




156
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,840
## would want to be spoken for if you're in their 
## position telling people the truth shouldn't be  




157
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,800
## perceived by you as something that will start 
## a fight because if you perceive it that way  




158
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,120
## maybe others will pick up on that but if you just 
## think that you're telling people the truth because  




159
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,200
## that's the loving thing to do then people will 
## pick up on that as well and they respect truth  




160
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,040
## people respect people who tell them the truth 
## have you ever heard the expression that you  




161
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,600
## don't lie to your friends you shouldn't 
## lie to your friends well if you extend that  




162
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:54,960
## to the public isn't that what being compassionate 
## is so people conflate veganism with compassionate  




163
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,320
## living a lot of the times as well i don't think 
## not stabbing animals to death is necessarily  




164
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,840
## compassionate i just think that's 
## the same and rational thing to do  




165
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,680
## but people also claim that this approach is not 
## compassionate that we're not being compassionate  




166
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,720
## to the abusers not giving them a chance but that's 
## nonsense because i'm a street activist that's all  




167
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,400
## i do is educate people i give people a chance to 
## wake up to this like i was i'm not forcing people  




168
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,400
## to go vegan that's physically impossible to do if 
## that was possible i'd probably be doing it right  




169
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,440
## now but you can't do that so you have to focus 
## on just talking to people and hoping they wake up  




170
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,320
## and that is the most compassionate thing 
## that you can do is offer people education  




171
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,840
## but again telling people the truth is 
## truly the most loving thing that you can do  




172
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,320
## i don't know why we think it's hateful 
## people say you're shaming people  




173
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,800
## we're not necessarily shaming people 
## we are making people feel guilty though  




174
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,240
## because how else are we going to make people go 
## vegan if they don't feel guilty isn't that why  




175
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,760
## you went vegan because you felt incredibly guilty 
## for what you were contributing to well why would  




176
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,720
## we avoid having others feel that why would we 
## try to avoid that why would we dance around the  




177
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,320
## topic and compromise on the message and panda 
## when that's the goal is for them to feel guilty




178
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,840
## this is the real form of compassion that i see 
## that we need to bring into this movement more  




179
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:34,800
## is telling non-vegans the truth and one thing that 
## will happen when you're talking to non-vegans is  




180
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,840
## you're going to notice a lot of conscious and 
## some conscious distractions that come out so  




181
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,960
## whether they're consciously and maliciously doing 
## that or not you have to be aware of the fact that  




182
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,720
## they're going to distract away from what needs to 
## be discussed because their guilt is going to be  




183
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,480
## flaring when you're talking about something 
## that's obviously wrong everybody knows that  




184
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,080
## animal abuse is wrong that's the other thing 
## is that we think as vegans that people don't  




185
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,680
## already know about this people walk over to a cube 
## instantly know that we're vegan instantly know  




186
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,480
## that we're trying to promote an animal rights 
## message it may not have been the case 10 years ago  




187
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,160
## but the temperament of the times right now from 
## what i can see is that most people already get the  




188
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,800
## fact that we're talking about animal rights we're 
## talking about veganism and they need to go vegan  




189
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:29,040
## that's the crux of the conversation that they're 
## going to have with us so don't act like non-vegans  




190
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,000
## don't know this okay they already know we're a 
## lot more obvious about this than we think we are  




191
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,320
## when we have these very simple conversations with 
## people their guilt will flare up and they start  




192
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,040
## creating distractions that they don't even believe 
## in like plants have feelings they're trying to  




193
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,760
## distract from them taking accountability 
## from themselves taking accountability for  




194
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,680
## what they're doing it's your role again as a 
## medium of truth to anchor the conversation back  




195
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,240
## to make sure that that individual is in the 
## hot seat and it's not just something that they  




196
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,080
## can just palm off and the distractions that 
## they're creating you have to break through  




197
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,640
## them that's your job as an activist is to break 
## through them and not let the distractions become  




198
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,320
## real distractions for what needs to be 
## discussed you've all heard non-vegan  




199
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,040
## excuses i'm sure a lot of people think when i 
## do an outreach workshop i'm going to get into  




200
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,200
## how to deal with excuses how to deal with certain 
## arguments i'm not actually going to do that  




201
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,920
## if you have questions during the q a though i'll 
## answer them for you but i'm not going to do that  




202
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:41,520
## because i've come to know that they're all just 
## ridiculous excuses and there is no excuse under  




203
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,840
## the sun that should ever trump you plants have 
## feelings if people really believe that plants  




204
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,640
## have feelings how come we don't have a single 
## group out there that protest against lawn mowing




205
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,280
## how come when the australian bushfires 
## occurred we didn't hear anything about the  




206
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,960
## plants burning to death we only heard about 
## the wildlife and when they said wild life
