598
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,320
## let's let's go on to the




599
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,159
## like more let's go into a solid topic




600
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,600
## something we can really like get into




601
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,360
## and kind of debunk so




602
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
## one of the more common things that came




603
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,120
## up with my questions that came up




604
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
## questions that came up sorry topics that




605
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
## came up was




606
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,080
## about money now we talked about the




607
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,440
## donor obviously




608
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,280
## but we didn't talk about the general




609
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,720
## things that people




610
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
## seem to be obsessing over when it comes




611
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,840
## to av




612
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,240
## so these general money concerns as i've




613
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,840
## called on my general money concerns they




614
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,280
## include things like people are upset




615
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,240
## because




616
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
## you guys didn't want to release




617
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
## financial records they're upset because




618
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,640
## apparently




619
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,559
## that they don't know or you have not




620
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,799
## released where donations go




621
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,080
## um they're upset because they




622
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,760
## the the chapters are claiming they




623
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,280
## receive no money




624
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,480
## um so so i know you've dealt with some




625
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,919
## of this on your own channel and i'm




626
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,200
## on your own videos and i guess you're




627
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,440
## sick of talking about it but




628
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,159
## again my aim today is to get into it and




629
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,120
## and to ask




630
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,039
## maybe more questions that maybe people




631
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,200
## haven't you guys maybe haven't had




632
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
## before and to get




633
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,440
## really some solid facts and detail out




634
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,799
## here so that people can't




635
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,600
## continue to discuss this randomly like




636
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
## you said i feel like we need to vet




637
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,720
## these things rather than just taking




638
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,880
## people's words um




639
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
## so what what is that situation then so




640
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
## let's let's be more specific with the




641
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,520
## question




642
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,840
## there's money coming in and obviously




643
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,280
## there's money going out




644
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,840
## um people are claiming that there's a




645
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,720
## problem that they




646
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,280
## don't know what's coming in and where




647
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,159
## it's going




648
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
## so how would you respond to that like




649
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,919
## what what do you think




650
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,919
## uh how can you reassure these people




651
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,000
## that it's going where it should be




652
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,240
## or you know what the situation is what




653
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,360
## the financial situation is




654
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,880
## i think going back to what you were




655
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,559
## saying before about like




656
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,720
## how it's the cool thing now to hate on




657
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,840
## av




658
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,919
## it's also the cool thing to just ask




659
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,760
## these questions because you don't




660
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,679
## you don't see other organizations or




661
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,120
## other activists being asked the same




662
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,080
## questions




663
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
## and the people that are asking these




664
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,480
## questions and making the same claims




665
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,120
## don't have any kind of evidence to back




666
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,080
## up their claim




667
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
## so it's just because somebody brought it




668
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,840
## up in the comment section and they saw




669
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,440
## it they're just going to repeat it




670
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,960
## and then the next person is going to say




671
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,120
## the same thing so




672
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,480
## um like the fact that we have never done




673
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,120
## any financial reports is actually




674
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,919
## [ __ ] because it's not that we're not




675
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,159
## willing to do it as that we haven't been




676
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,240
## required to do it yet




677
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,679
## and if anyone is actually interested




678
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,679
## all of this information is public so




679
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,360
## they can just go and look it up




680
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
## and they will have access to and they




681
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,480
## can see that




682
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,880
## um we're required to do our first




683
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,240
## financial




684
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,000
## um what is it called like reporting




685
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,559
## this year end of the year or it's




686
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,600
## probably going to be delayed




687
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,760
## next year actually because of coverage




688
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,799
## but




689
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,600
## because we registered av as a non-for




690
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,159
## profit




691
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,039
## i think it was in 2018 the way it works




692
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,640
## here you don't you're not




693
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
## asked to do a reporting for like the




694
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,600
## first year or the first couple of years




695
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
## so it's not that we because otherwise we




696
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
## wouldn't be able to run




697
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,480
## av if we hadn't done our




698
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,919
## um legal requirements




699
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,520
## whatever it is that you know the




700
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
## government is asking you to do as a




701
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,720
## not-for-profit




702
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,320
## it's not like you can just say no i'm




703
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
## not going to do my reporting and then




704
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
## you can continue to run av




705
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,120
## as a not-for-profit so um




706
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
## yeah like i said these claims are just




707
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,880
## faceless there's no evidence and also




708
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,080
## people have no reason




709
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,320
## to think that the money is not going




710
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
## where we say it's going




711
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,880
## if somebody has proof that the money is




712
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
## going elsewhere then




713
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,679
## they need to come forward and show us




714
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,000
## where the money is going um




715
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
## we have explained this like you said




716
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,679
## multiple times we have told people where




717
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,520
## the money is going like with all these




718
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,880
## different categories




719
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
## so we can just repeat that but i feel




720
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,200
## like these people are committed




721
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,960
## to think a certain way and no matter




722
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
## what you say they're just not gonna




723
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,440
## believe you




724
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,320
## so yeah i i just don't know if there's




725
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,919
## anything else that we can say




726
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,960
## to clarify this for people yeah i




727
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
## i guess for the sake of for the sake of




728
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,080
## this um




729
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,679
## for the sake of this stream i don't want




730
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,760
## i i don't i'm not interested in going




731
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,720
## through literally




732
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
## like i wouldn't expect you to do this to




733
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,240
## go through like okay we spend this much




734
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
## here and this much




735
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,960
## i don't want to do that that's just it's




736
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
## not you don't owe that to people




737
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
## watching this i think




738
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,799
## what i'm more interested in is like




739
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
## maybe you could just list off




740
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,159
## like the things that i don't know the




741
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,840
## biggest spending from av




742
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
## and like where it goes to give people an




743
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,360
## idea because uh maybe some people




744
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,039
## genuinely have no idea




745
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,559
## where an organization like av would




746
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,159
## spend money let's assume they're asking




747
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:44,880
## it




748
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
## out of you know interest rather than out




749
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,000
## of accusation




750
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,360
## like if somebody asked you hey i'm just




751
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,880
## curious like where would it go like




752
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,159
## where do you spend the most money




753
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,919
## how would you answer that question like




754
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,159
## just just to appease them let's say or




755
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,360
## just




756
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,360
## you know
