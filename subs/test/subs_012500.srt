2555
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,880
## you know about humans have been through




2556
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:03,280
## so




2557
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,480
## it's not something that should be




2558
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,560
## accepted um




2559
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,880
## just because it's big and because it's




2560
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,840
## being pushed




2561
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,480
## but at the same time for good or for bad




2562
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,880
## there are people out there who




2563
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,679
## uh yeah like specifically it is it is




2564
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:18,159
## very much




2565
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,080
## intertwined with trends with the trans




2566
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,600
## issues which is why it keeps coming up




2567
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,040
## and this you didn't you said earlier i




2568
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,239
## don't understand why people keep saying




2569
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,199
## it's about trans




2570
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,120
## it's because i feel i feel personally i




2571
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,639
## don't tell me if i'm wrong i feel like




2572
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:29,360
## that




2573
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,480
## that um i wouldn't say popularity but




2574
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,040
## the




2575
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,120
## the more exposure let's say the more




2576
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,040
## awareness of trends and what it means to




2577
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:37,840
## be trans




2578
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,639
## has also come tied in with gender and




2579
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:41,840
## and gender identity




2580
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,120
## yeah because right yeah confuse the




2581
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,040
## issue though i think deliberately they




2582
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:47,520
## have to




2583
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,560
## use the two now it's like all mixed in




2584
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,120
## but it doesn't need to be because when




2585
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,880
## we're talking about gender pronouns and




2586
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,440
## gender




2587
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,400
## we're talking about gender roles and




2588
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,199
## like




2589
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,760
## you can you can be a female like you can




2590
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,080
## be born a female in a female body but




2591
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,760
## you may not necessarily




2592
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,600
## feel like you are fitting into that




2593
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,120
## you know that i don't know mindset or




2594
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,000
## that




2595
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
## gender role and that's totally fine but




2596
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,520
## that's not what we're talking about when




2597
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,960
## we're talking about like someone




2598
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,800
## transitioning you're talking about them




2599
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,159
## changing their their




2600
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,320
## body and that's the sex it's like when




2601
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,400
## you go to the doctor they they care




2602
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,880
## about knowing your birth sex because




2603
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,800
## you know the doctor needs about your




2604
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,120
## body and your biology so that's why




2605
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,719
## sex and gender are different and if




2606
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:37,360
## anyone wants to confuse the two




2607
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,280
## that's just not gonna you know that's




2608
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,199
## fine but that's that's just not the




2609
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,400
## reality of it




2610
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,760
## they're completely separate uh




2611
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,320
## and my trans um supporters tell me this




2612
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:55,360
## and and i agree with them convoluting




2613
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,440
## conflating gender politics




2614
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,719
## uh the gender pronoun




2615
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,800
## issue in society that's been brought up




2616
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,360
## uh with the trans movement and struggle




2617
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,639
## of trans people




2618
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,080
## is actually diminishing them as victims




2619
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,560
## of their struggle so it takes away from




2620
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,080
## what they're really dealing with and




2621
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,840
## uh they're not struggling with gender




2622
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,440
## pronouns necessarily like the




2623
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,080
## the the struggles are different they're




2624
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,840
## they're struggling




2625
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,239
## with uh with just being accepted as a




2626
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:29,679
## trans person and that's a different




2627
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:30,639
## discussion




2628
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,560
## completely to what we're discussing here




2629
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,080
## this is what they tell me




2630
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,000
## and i agree with them and uh




2631
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,440
## it's disrespectful to the trans movement




2632
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,000
## to just attach all these other things to




2633
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,719
## it and say that's a trans issue too




2634
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,719
## yeah if you care about the trans




2635
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:49,760
## movement




2636
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,000
## then you wouldn't do that i understand




2637
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,040
## so yeah




2638
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,880
## there's a distinction between just




2639
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,560
## wanting to identify




2640
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,920
## as one of the limitless genders and




2641
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:00,639
## actually




2642
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,199
## suffering from gender dysphoria and and




2643
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:04,960
## changing your sex and wanting to be




2644
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,400
## referred to as a different pronoun




2645
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,120
## because




2646
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,679
## it it validates who you are and it's




2647
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:10,560
## something that you have




2648
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,320
## struggled through yes you're drawing




2649
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,920
## there's a distinction between the two




2650
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:14,800
## basically




2651
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,719
## is what you're saying right there




2652
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,159
## absolutely is and




2653
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,760
## trans people around the world feel




2654
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,080
## diminished because of this




2655
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:25,360
## this incessant um obsessive




2656
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,480
## need to link it to everything else and




2657
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,280
## have already




2658
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,560
## finished on top okay but




2659
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,840
## it's but although although you hold this




2660
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,960
## belief and obviously av




2661
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,840
## operates on this um not belief i




2662
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,520
## wouldn't say but let's say opinion




2663
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,520
## and the av operates also on this opinion




2664
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,679
## like that av will not accept




2665
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,719
## um people bringing in ideologies




2666
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,320
## um without let's say like obviously




2667
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,000
## trans trend the trans movement isn't an




2668
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,040
## ideology um




2669
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,400
## not for the not for the people who are




2670
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,480
## actually uh you know suffering from




2671
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,159
## gender dysphoria anyway although there




2672
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,679
## are people who are calling themselves




2673
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,199
## trans who are actually not




2674
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,560
## don't have gender dysphoria then that's




2675
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,159
## an ideology i would say that's different




2676
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,360
## that's a political




2677
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,679
## um ideology or or some i don't know




2678
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,280
## ideology of some sort




2679
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,320
## um but unfortunately i would say it is




2680
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,719
## it is difficult to actually determine




2681
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:17,520
## who is who




2682
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,840
## right and and who is for real and who is




2683
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,440
## doing this because they genuinely




2684
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,600
## you know are a trans person and who is




2685
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,280
## doing this because they have




2686
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,560
## they want to get on board with an




2687
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,719
## ideology and and kind of i don't know




2688
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,760
## be different um i guess




2689
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,159
## how does av how does it how is av going




2690
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:35,840
## to operate with that because




2691
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,840
## i know that you like you've just said




2692
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,679
## you'll you accept people who have




2693
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,040
## uh and you accept and will respect




2694
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,800
## people who are genuinely




2695
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,040
## you know are trans or or whatever if




2696
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,719
## they have whatever condition the av




2697
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:48,239
## will respect them and people will be




2698
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,760
## booted if they don't respect them




2699
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,600
## but then also in the same breath you're




2700
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,840
## saying that the political ideology is




2701
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,199
## not actually welcome




2702
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,120
## and so if somebody isn't actually trans




2703
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,639
## and they are just identifying as someone




2704
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,159
## else because it's something they want to
