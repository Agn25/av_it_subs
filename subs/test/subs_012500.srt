01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:07,840
## health health so health is conditional you can 
## absolutely receive some amazing health benefits  




798
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,440
## depending on how you coordinate your lifestyle but 
## the number one benefit would first of course be  




799
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:18,880
## for the animals they would no longer be abused 
## because of you but as individuals the number  




800
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:24,480
## one benefit would be if you say you're against 
## animal abuse and you look at these screens and  




801
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:31,680
## you're disgusted by it then you no longer have to 
## be a hypocrite it's really important that we don't  




802
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:37,200
## just say have a nice day after telling them the 
## benefit it's really important that you ask them  




803
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:42,160
## what they're going to do that's how you should 
## end the interaction so what do you think you'll do  




804
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:46,080
## and when people say i'll try to do better then you 
## tie in the fact that they shouldn't try they need  




805
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:52,480
## to do and the best way to end it is so what do 
## you think you'll do it's really important that  




806
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,360
## you close off strongly because then it's like 
## the whole interaction was for nothing if you  




807
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:03,680
## don't close it off properly without that close it 
## really like seals the whole conversation and they  




808
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:07,440
## really understand what the imperative is they're 
## after after seeing this footage after having  




809
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,200
## this conversation what do you think you'll 
## do moving forward regarding this suffering  




810
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,640
## i mean something had to be done but




811
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:24,560
## so like just right there when hudson said what 
## do you think you'll do about this suffering  




812
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,360
## i'm just going to add this on and i'm 
## sure hudson will appreciate this because  




813
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:34,080
## he always appreciates these little updates but 
## he's absolutely killing it in these examples  




814
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:42,000
## um the suffering that you cause the suffering 
## that's happening because of you just a little  




815
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:50,880
## added update that i would make there and 
## i'll just go back this footage after having  




816
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,640
## this conversation what do you think you'll 
## do moving forward regarding this suffering  




817
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:03,840
## i mean something had to be done but i 
## don't know just keep in mind that until  




818
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,520
## the day comes that you're vegan animals




819
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:18,080
## so i guess i spoke too soon there 
## because he ties in right here  




820
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:24,400
## um that further accountability that i was looking 
## to add into that comment he just made so let's  




821
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:28,880
## just retract that comment i made because 
## he really does double down at the end here  




822
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:36,400
## to make sure that this is happening because of 
## the individual so let's just continue our gonna  




823
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:43,280
## are gonna be victimized something had to be done 
## but i don't know just keep in mind that until  




824
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:51,280
## the day comes that you're vegan animals are 
## going to be victimized and abused because of you  




825
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:55,600
## so just think about what side of history you 
## want to stand on when it comes to stamping out  




826
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:02,720
## this particular injustice what do you think you 
## guys are going to do leaving here i feel like  




827
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,400
## i'll i'll think more about it i feel like the 
## next time i have me but whether they come vegan  




828
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:12,800
## i don't want to see that in my future to be honest 
## but i mean yeah just remember until the day that  




829
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,680
## you do align those actions with the words that 
## you said during this conversation that animals  




830
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:23,360
## will be abused because of you so just decide what 
## side of history you want to stand on what do you  




831
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:27,360
## guys think you're going to do after seeing this 
## footage i don't know i'm definitely going to try  




832
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:32,000
## to be more conscious about it i don't know if 
## i'm ready to fully be a vegan but i don't know




833
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,920
## what i'll leave you guys with is that um 
## you agree that when you're taking baby steps  




834
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:46,320
## just keep in mind that for however long you are 
## taking baby steps animals are going to be tortured  




835
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:54,640
## for you guys so when you're ready to stop abusing 
## animals and stop being hypocrites then you guys  




836
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,720
## can be vegan so think about what side of history 
## you guys want to stand on all right what do  




837
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:03,760
## you think you're going to do leaving here we 
## rethink my [ __ ] process in terms of what i eat  




838
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,840
## for sure because i want to i want 
## to be a better person again is




839
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,600
## just understand that until the day that 
## you do decide to align your actions  




840
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,720
## with the beliefs that you said 
## you've had during this conversation  




841
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:25,760
## the animals will be abused because of you so just 
## decide what side of history you want to stand on  




842
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:31,280
## when stamping out this particular injustice now 
## i know this seems confrontational you guys are




843
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:39,280
## i just want to take a moment to give 
## a quick shout out to jacob and hudson  




844
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:46,640
## for those very fine examples they are killing it 
## right now and really adopting this approach whoops




845
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:54,240
## i hope the audio was okay there but just want 
## to shout out to jacob and hudson they're doing  




846
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:59,680
## great work you're thinking [ __ ] i don't know if 
## i could just decide what side of history you want  




847
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:05,920
## to stand on when stamping out this particular 
## injustice now i know this seems confrontational
