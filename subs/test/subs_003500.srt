305
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,240
## on your morals if you understand that this is 
## wrong you're not gonna go back on child abuse  




306
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,640
## you're not gonna wake up one day and think child 
## abuse is okay i think today i'm comfortable with  




307
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,840
## this idea i'm gonna do it today it's black and 
## white it's always wrong and it's never justified  




308
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,000
## another thing that vegans will focus way too 
## much on when advocating for animal rights  




309
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,960
## is being liked by the other person we think that 
## being likable vegans is going to get people to  




310
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,080
## take veganism seriously raise your hand if 
## you've fallen into this trap i know i have  




311
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,960
## thank you for being honest because we don't want 
## to be the preachy vegan we don't want to be the  




312
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,120
## pushy vegan we don't want to be the annoying 
## vegan we don't want to be the vegan that turns  




313
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:51,040
## people off veganism here's the thing non-vegans 
## have been trying to bully us psychologically  




314
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,720
## into this thinking and you need to realize that 
## and you know better this is just manipulation  




315
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,000
## people are trying to make you feel insecure about 
## this because they're shooting down the messenger  




316
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,360
## because they don't want to take the message 
## seriously and face it when we play into this  




317
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:19,840
## they win when i say they the abusers and the 
## animals lose it's a flaw to care about being liked  




318
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,840
## more than what you're saying and the rights 
## of these animals the rights of these beings  




319
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,600
## in no other situation do we actually use 
## this line of thinking so we're actually  




320
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,840
## being hypocrites here you probably noticed 
## that people actually like people who don't  




321
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,320
## really care what other people think of them when 
## you don't care what other people think of you  




322
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,440
## and to the contrary when you care so 
## much about what other people think of you  




323
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
## people actually don't like that they don't like 
## that about you because it comes off as a weakness  




324
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,760
## and i actually think that telling people the 
## truth is the best way to achieve this anyway  




325
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,880
## so it's counterproductive if you want to be liked 
## then do things that are deserving of being liked  




326
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,920
## and this shouldn't be your goal being life 
## shouldn't be your goal because if somebody  




327
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,280
## likes you and goes vegan for that reason 
## what happens when they don't like you anymore




328
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,160
## which will happen




329
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,800
## imagine civil rights activists 
## focusing on being liked by white people  




330
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,800
## in order for them to take black rights 
## seriously how weird would that be trying to be  




331
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,000
## accommodating in whichever way socially to have 
## them taking black rights seriously it would be  




332
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,120
## insane to even witness that happening and this is 
## also a tool that you should use in your advocacy  




333
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,560
## to make sure that you're in line with what you're 
## supposed to be doing here as an activist if you  




334
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,760
## ever feel like questioning what you're 
## doing compare it to any other injustice  




335
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,920
## would you be advocating this way in 
## any other case for any other injustice  




336
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,840
## if not don't do it here animals deserve 
## way better from us when we first started av




337
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,880
## i noticed that the outreach that 
## we were doing on the streets  




338
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,760
## i noticed that there was a lot of 
## things that i learned in my previous  




339
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,000
## work experience in doing sales all 
## the sales training that i had received  




340
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,760
## there were things in that that i could carry 
## over into outreach that were applicable here  




341
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,640
## and so if you go on our website it says we use 
## a value-based sales approach i want to explain  




342
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,960
## what that means because i think there's been 
## a bit of a confusion about this i definitely  




343
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,840
## don't mean the kind of sales that we're 
## commonly used to and that we commonly know  




344
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,360
## i'm talking about certain aspects of sales that 
## are applicable here because at the end of the day  




345
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,200
## what we're doing is trying to convince somebody 
## of something they're not already convinced on  




346
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,640
## and that's what sales is really i'm trying to 
## convince you right now to apply this approach when  




347
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,680
## you're doing outreach and that's why i brought 
## this into this equation but i want to explain  




348
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,360
## that i really do not mean schmoozing people and 
## telling people what you think they want to hear  




349
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:25,920
## and using hooks like psychological hooks to trick 
## them into signing on the dotted line that's not  




350
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,760
## how this works at all activism is a different 
## ballpark to sales one of the traditional things  




351
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,280
## that occurs in sales is the three-step process for 
## any sale so i'll talk you through that right now  




352
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,320
## the three-step process is really simple 
## the first step is all right i'm gonna




353
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,600
## okay i'm gonna pause right here because this 
## is the part where i find that there's the most  




354
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:57,280
## confusion and it's the whole sales message so yes 
## i'm going to break down this three-step process  




355
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:04,240
## but the only reason i'm doing that here is to 
## show you where sales tools and really they're
