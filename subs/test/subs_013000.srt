2705
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:00,960
## do




2706
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,760
## so how is av going to actually how would




2707
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:04,639
## you operate with




2708
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:06,320
## these two individuals let's say being




2709
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,760
## around how are you going to determine




2710
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,239
## who




2711
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,239
## who should be respected and and you know




2712
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,440
## should be dealt with in a




2713
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,760
## very in a respectful way and who should




2714
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,199
## actually be told no




2715
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:16,719
## don't bring your ideologies here leave




2716
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,320
## it at home




2717
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,520
## well everyone everyone everyone needs to




2718
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,040
## be respected




2719
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,719
## okay everyone including




2720
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,639
## yeah that's the answer everyone needs to




2721
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:29,840
## be respected so




2722
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,000
## i mean uh




2723
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,560
## everyone is entitled to their opinions




2724
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,080
## but no one is entitled




2725
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:42,400
## to use their to weaponize their opinions




2726
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,440
## against others and that's my




2727
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,800
## most accurate answer to that okay sure




2728
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,360
## everyone is respected for their opinions




2729
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,520
## and their right to have an opinion




2730
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,600
## no one has a right to weaponize their




2731
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,920
## opinion against others in any way




2732
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,320
## and so




2733
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,120
## that's it i mean you know where do we




2734
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,800
## draw the line with human stuff as well




2735
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,360
## because




2736
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,199
## we allow people who are disabled to come




2737
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:08,639
## to our cubes and




2738
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,800
## rock a wheelchair in the cube we've had




2739
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,320
## so many people in




2740
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,040
## wheelchairs in our cubes around the




2741
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,320
## world




2742
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,880
## we don't say




2743
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,080
## we don't you know we welcome these




2744
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,760
## people i don't know why i'm using that




2745
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,080
## as a point i guess it's just of course




2746
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,440
## we welcome different




2747
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,760
## uh struggles and we accommodate




2748
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,600
## different struggles within nav




2749
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,000
## but only as far as getting the job done




2750
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:34,880
## is required




2751
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,320
## because we're there for the animals and




2752
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,320
## that just needs to be respected also




2753
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,719
## everyone needs to be respected




2754
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,719
## for the mission when we're at the cube




2755
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,159
## but i think we should move on now to the




2756
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,040
## next




2757
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,840
## subject all right all right okay can i




2758
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,440
## close off of the bottom line and bottom




2759
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,960
## line yes or no question and then we'll




2760
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,600
## move on is that all right with you




2761
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,920
## but it's bottom line yes or no then so




2762
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,600
## what i'm understanding is




2763
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,920
## that someone comes to the cube they




2764
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,600
## request to be called




2765
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,719
## a certain thing and people in the cubes




2766
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:08,320
## people the organizers




2767
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,600
## are requested to respect that and




2768
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,120
## if they get it wrong by accident no




2769
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,880
## worries don't do it again if you get it




2770
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,920
## wrong on purpose you're being




2771
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,520
## disrespectful and you'll be




2772
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,840
## you'll be if it comes up you will be




2773
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,320
## told either told off or or i don't know




2774
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,480
## warned and saying that that's bullying




2775
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,480
## am i right is that correct is that if i




2776
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,000
## understood this correctly or is there




2777
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,639
## something i've missed




2778
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:38,320
## um sorry i




2779
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,560
## sorry i just kind of zoned out for a bit




2780
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:41,440
## so you said




2781
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,320
## right somebody got it wrong by accident




2782
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,440
## no worries




2783
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,719
## obviously what are we gonna do um




2784
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,800
## and then if they did it on purpose




2785
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,080
## they're gonna get kicked out




2786
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,159
## is that always not kicked out whatever




2787
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:55,920
## it may be they'd be either warned




2788
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,840
## or if it's been multiple times let's say




2789
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,440
## you would you would take a further




2790
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,560
## action if it's if it's




2791
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,320
## becoming a habit you know if it's




2792
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,679
## something they've done more than once




2793
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,120
## for example




2794
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,239
## yeah um yeah basically but like what i




2795
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,400
## was saying earlier if somebody feels




2796
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,639
## that strongly about it that they're not




2797
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,880
## willing to because they feel like




2798
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,040
## they're accepting that ideology




2799
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,400
## by referring to um say you showed up at




2800
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,920
## a cube and you want to be referred to as




2801
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,320
## she




2802
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,280
## and like i just can't accept that then




2803
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,560
## in that case




2804
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,679
## they could refer to you with




2805
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,400
## your name and if they're not willing to




2806
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,040
## do that




2807
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,040
## then yes that would be an issue because




2808
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,159
## then that person




2809
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,000
## buying this thing on not wanting to




2810
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,920
## refer to you as whatever




2811
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,000
## then that that person is taking away




2812
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,440
## from the event in the queue




2813
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,280
## because they're good yeah they're making




2814
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,040
## good about anything else




2815
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,560
## yeah they're making yeah okay but i




2816
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,080
## think that yeah that




2817
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,400
## seems reasonable to me but i'm i'm i




2818
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,560
## guess it's not good enough for everyone




2819
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,080
## for a lot of people but i i feel like




2820
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,520
## it's reasonable i just wanted to clarify




2821
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,880
## it before we moved on though




2822
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,760
## yeah when we move on i just want to say




2823
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,280
## one more time like this has




2824
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,920
## literally never happened in our personal




2825
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:06,719
## experience has




2826
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:09,760
## never happened and i haven't heard of a




2827
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,960
## specific




2828
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,560
## um event where this was the issue and




2829
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:14,960
## this




2830
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,840
## this was brought up and somebody you




2831
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,520
## know had an issue with




2832
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,679
## referring to someone else with their




2833
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,120
## preferred name or pronouns




2834
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,719
## i just want to say how uncommon this is




2835
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,199
## but yeah i guess it's just about future




2836
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:30,880
## proofing because this is the world we're




2837
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:31,199
## in




2838
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:34,000
## um now you know uh it's it's i don't




2839
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,600
## think it's a bad world that we're in i




2840
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,520
## think it's good i think uh




2841
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,960
## that's why i wanted to really get into




2842
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,719
## it because i i am 100




2843
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,639
## certain that as as we go into the future




2844
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:44,000
## this is going to become more and more




2845
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,440
## and more common and not just in




2846
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:48,239
## av in other organizations like you know




2847
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:48,960
## jobs like




2848
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,480
## people working in offices and stuff like




2849
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:51,760
## that this is going to start becoming




2850
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,679
## more and more common because




2851
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,520
## people you know in general people don't




2852
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,880
## like change um




2853
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,360
## in general uh so you're gonna have to i




2854
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,719
## think we i feel we hope we all have to
