1628
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:01,920
## was going on




1629
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,760
## in america during the protests in




1630
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,359
## minnesota and throughout




1631
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,240
## other states said really nothing about




1632
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,520
## what happened in lebanon




1633
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,520
## for example yeah they are very selective




1634
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,400
## yeah the causes that they choose to




1635
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,480
## speak up about and that's the thing




1636
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,599
## because when people ask us to do the




1637
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,400
## same thing




1638
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,200
## they're asking us to to speak up for




1639
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,319
## those specific




1640
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,559
## issues um because you know how




1641
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,319
## many different things are out there that




1642
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,079
## you could be speaking about when it




1643
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,680
## comes to human rights




1644
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,799
## there are so many different things and i




1645
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:39,280
## don't know




1646
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,960
## anyone who claims to be an




1647
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,559
## intersectional and




1648
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,440
## they actually cover all of those issues




1649
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,720
## there's literally




1650
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,400
## thousands of different things that you




1651
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,920
## could talk about and i




1652
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,640
## i only see these people focusing on two




1653
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,400
## or three different categories and they




1654
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,520
## want us to do the same




1655
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,440
## and that points out that you do have to




1656
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,799
## choose your cause




1657
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,040
## yeah because if they're claiming you




1658
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,559
## have to speak up for all of them




1659
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,319
## well there's literally thousands of




1660
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,920
## injustices occurring right now




1661
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,040
## around the world all the time so




1662
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,119
## it's not only impractical it's




1663
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,400
## impossible




1664
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,480
## for you to physically pull that off to




1665
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,599
## actually speak up for




1666
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,599
## all of them yeah and to fight




1667
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,799
## to end all of them all at once i mean




1668
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,079
## think about how insane that is so these




1669
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,520
## people are being hypocrites




1670
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,760
## because these people are choosing their




1671
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,799
## causes




1672
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,680
## which is guess what we have you have our




1673
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,559
## support




1674
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,720
## you have our full support to do that




1675
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,480
## because we chose a cause




1676
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,000
## yeah and that's how it is you guys are




1677
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,760
## doing the same thing that we're doing




1678
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,760
## how about we i'm actually taking this




1679
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,920
## moment to see where we have




1680
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,040
## something in common and maybe you




1681
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,559
## should do the same thing instead of




1682
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,400
## looking at where we have a difference or




1683
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,359
## where you think you're more holier than




1684
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,000
## that




1685
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,040
## or something to that effect have you




1686
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,319
## considered this before




1687
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,559
## there's a concept that actually if i




1688
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,599
## i'll tell you who who




1689
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,440
## introduced me to it but um this was




1690
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,799
## actually back in the day when things




1691
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,000
## were a little bit nicer but it was




1692
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,040
## actually anita




1693
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,960
## who introduced me to this concept um




1694
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,880
## years like maybe a year and a half ago




1695
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,240
## two years ago when i




1696
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,480
## i brought up the i brought up some




1697
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,079
## comments about insectionality and i kind




1698
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,000
## of warned anita that it looked like this




1699
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,440
## was going to start to take a turn for




1700
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,000
## the worse




1701
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,160
## people were starting to attack me for




1702
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,359
## not you know saying




1703
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,119
## certain things or for saying certain




1704
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,640
## things and i felt like it was starting




1705
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,160
## to seep into organizations and i




1706
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,119
## mentioned this and




1707
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,319
## she told me we won't do this because we




1708
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,520
## are all about positive




1709
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,280
## intersectionality and she had this




1710
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,960
## concept and this mindset and it really




1711
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,799
## inspired me actually because she said




1712
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,240
## we can fight for the animals 100 always




1713
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,720
## but when there are situations where it




1714
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,319
## also benefits humans




1715
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,280
## we can also note it for example look




1716
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,599
## these




1717
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,160
## vegans went out and gave free food to




1718
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,359
## the homeless because




1719
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,680
## they're suffering they're doing animal




1720
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,440
## rights activism by teaching the homeless




1721
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,400
## about veganism




1722
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,079
## and they're helping the homeless for




1723
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,599
## example that would be a positive




1724
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,079
## intersectional message right it's not no




1725
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,839
## one loses out here the animals are




1726
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,480
## focused




1727
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,520
## and the the homeless people have a focus




1728
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,760
## in lebanon for example with the blast




1729
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,240
## the the vegans the local vegans




1730
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,240
## were doing incredible work they were




1731
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,079
## getting like food out to everyone they




1732
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:24,799
## were like




1733
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,960
## you know um helping the vegan businesses




1734
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,920
## in the area they were helping the




1735
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,200
## animals in the area it was it was




1736
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,079
## amazing




1737
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,160
## but you're also raising awareness of




1738
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,920
## that corrupt government and how this




1739
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,440
## even happened in the first place




1740
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,400
## it's it's two in one it's easy right um




1741
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,839
## and this was great when she said this i




1742
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:40,960
## was really inspired but obviously we




1743
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,640
## know how that went and it didn't end up




1744
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,359
## staying




1745
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,760
## um staying that way unfortunately but




1746
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,200
## for you guys like what do you think




1747
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,799
## about av in that sense do you think this




1748
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,319
## is something av could do




1749
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,079
## like with social media i mean not with




1750
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,520
## the cubes but like with how you




1751
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,040
## represent yourselves on social media is




1752
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,640
## that something that you've thought about




1753
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,720
## or would ever consider or you do you




1754
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,559
## have do you disagree with that that kind




1755
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:00,880
## of




1756
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,280
## way of doing things




1757
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,960
## what way of doing things specifically




1758
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,799
## what is being suggested




1759
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,559
## so so like for example when there are




1760
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,000
## some um




1761
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,920
## when there is there are issues that




1762
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,480
## potentially could be both benefited by




1763
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,400
## raising awareness of it for example you




1764
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,079
## obviously av is 100 focused on the




1765
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,520
## animals but let's imagine




1766
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,000
## there is uh some of your av organizers




1767
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,880
## or your av




1768
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,480
## team goes out and gives food to the




1769
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,720
## homeless raising putting that on av




1770
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,760
## social media




1771
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,440
## and saying like look look look at what




1772
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,200
## our awesome activists are doing they're




1773
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,559
## fighting for the animals and they're




1774
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:35,520
## helping the homeless




1775
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,440
## do you see some pro a problem with doing




1776
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,040
## something like that or do you think that




1777
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,599
## that you agree with that as a as an idea




1778
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,040
## that specific suggestion




1779
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,599
## just sounds like we would be




1780
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,720
## i don't see how that helps




1781
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,000
## a human cause of any kind by making a




1782
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,119
## post like that




1783
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,200
## i don't see that as activism to help a




1784
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,960
## human cause




1785
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,880
## i mean at best it's congratulatory and
