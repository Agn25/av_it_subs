503
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,720
## take this approach you'll apply your 
## personality to it which i want you to do  




504
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,240
## but then what i don't want you to do is 
## butcher the approach itself and start  




505
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:17,040
## saying things differently to how i'm suggesting 
## that you say it so one little example is  




506
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:23,360
## we say we a lot when we're talking about 
## non-vegans and what they do to animals  




507
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:32,480
## we're not in that situation anymore so this is 
## pandering when we say the way we kill animals or  




508
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:39,840
## why do we do this to them you're not doing this to 
## them anymore so keep it accurate again apply apply  




509
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,240
## your personality by all means but just keep 
## it accurate and listen to what you're saying  




510
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,640
## you should make it very clear that the individual 
## you're speaking to needs to be held to account  




511
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,680
## not you i think i get why we've been focusing 
## on being liked more than promoting the message  




512
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,840
## at hand here and it's because the defensiveness 
## that we see coming from non-vegans i think is  




513
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:09,920
## more profound more astounding than perhaps any 
## of the defensiveness that we see in any other  




514
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,760
## group of culprits of perpetrators in the world 
## and i want to try to explain why i think that is  




515
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,640
## when it comes to eating it's the most intimate 
## connection we have with the outside world  




516
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,960
## this is why we see people getting a lot more 
## cognitively dissonant and defensive over the food  




517
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,640
## aspect of veganism as opposed to the clothing 
## aspects or the testing aspects of veganism  




518
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,240
## more people are willing to accept that wearing 
## fur is evil but when it comes to changing their  




519
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,680
## eating habits their defensiveness is truly 
## astounding this is what i experienced when i  




520
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:50,320
## was promoting a plant-based diet for almost two 
## years before i became an animal rights activist  




521
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,000
## so when you couple that with the fact that we 
## are addressing the largest and longest-standing  




522
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,080
## injustice with the most pressing issue of our 
## time and the fact that this is the most intimate  




523
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:08,640
## connection people have with the outside world 
## then you have to expect a nightmare i'm only going  




524
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,120
## to mention this one objection when people say i 
## only eat meat once in a while have you heard that  




525
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:18,320
## they only say this to vegans and this only happens 
## when they have a vegan in their environment  




526
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:25,840
## again this is just to prove to you how obvious 
## this is how obviously guilty people feel  




527
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,640
## it doesn't even take long for people 
## to say that to a vegan i don't eat meat  




528
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,560
## that much anyway i'm trying to eat less 
## and less meat to not participate today  




529
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:45,840
## i'm i ate a lot of meat before so i'm trying 
## to eat less it's hard to go really no meat for  




530
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:53,840
## me but i'm trying to do less and less so i'm 
## not participating in those games i lower my  




531
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,600
## i don't cook food anymore i don't cook meat 
## anymore but if i go to restaurants sometimes  




532
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:09,120
## i order meats okay yeah i'm not full vegan 
## myself but i try to at least five days a week  




533
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,000
## why are you saying that




534
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,320
## you wouldn't say that to your non-vegan friends  




535
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,840
## and it's as black and white as that you know 
## you're only a little bit of an animal abuser




536
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,280
## again they would never do this with any other 
## injustice they'd never be a little bit of a  




537
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,840
## child abuser the word speciesism the words 
## veganism and the word animal exploitation  




538
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,320
## and carnism as well carnist people 
## don't really understand these words  




539
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:46,160
## it doesn't really hit the way that we want them 
## to hit i'm not saying don't use these words  




540
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:52,080
## i say vegan all the time but i want you 
## to focus way more on what these words mean  




541
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,800
## and use words like human supremacism 
## because that clearly explains speciesism  




542
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,880
## and it clearly explains what being a non-vegan 
## is all about human supremacism and in terms of  




543
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,560
## exploitation i think people think of 
## sweatshop workers and i don't know they  




544
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,840
## think of exploitation the music industry in the 
## porn industry they don't really think of the  




545
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,240
## animals being hacked apart having the children 
## taken away from them the most torturous things  




546
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,720
## imaginable happening to these innocent beings 
## i don't really think of exploitation like that  




547
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:38,000
## so it is exploitation but the better word to 
## use here is animal abuse and human supremacism  




548
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:44,160
## statistics a lot of the times we feel the 
## need to bring up statistics you know 50 of  




549
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,760
## the world's crops are used to you know 3 trillion 
## animals are slaughtered every year by all means  




550
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:56,560
## do this but please keep this to an absolute 
## minimum because we're not supposed to be  




551
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,400
## highly educated and academic and it doesn't 
## need to be in order for people to take this
