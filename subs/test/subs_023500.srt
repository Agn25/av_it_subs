4680
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:03,120
## that video




4681
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:05,120
## there's no way to determine this we i




4682
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:06,479
## i'm only




4683
02:35:06,479 --> 02:35:09,840
## uh making an educated guess here okay




4684
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:11,920
## so even after hours and hours of




4685
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:13,359
## research being put into that video that




4686
02:35:13,359 --> 02:35:14,319
## was her conclusion




4687
02:35:14,319 --> 02:35:16,479
## but how are these individuals coming to




4688
02:35:16,479 --> 02:35:18,080
## this conclusion when




4689
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:21,920
## is where is his daughter even being




4690
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:22,880
## logged




4691
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:24,960
## how all those marine animals that are




4692
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:26,800
## slaughtered in the fish industry are




4693
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:28,240
## they being logged




4694
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:30,640
## who's who's noting how many animals are




4695
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,000
## being murdered like




4696
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,800
## it's all an assumption and um i wouldn't




4697
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:35,200
## trust




4698
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:37,840
## any any piece of information coming from




4699
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:38,960
## animal agriculture




4700
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:42,080
## of course or any study that's funded by




4701
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:43,520
## animal agriculture of course




4702
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:45,520
## if it says something to the effect that




4703
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:46,960
## their products are on the rise and




4704
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:48,479
## they're doing really well and all this i




4705
02:35:48,479 --> 02:35:49,920
## wouldn't trust that




4706
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:52,720
## and especially since we know actually




4707
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:54,399
## that the dairy industry is on its way




4708
02:35:54,399 --> 02:35:54,880
## out




4709
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:57,280
## there's many indicators of that so it




4710
02:35:57,280 --> 02:35:58,240
## depends on




4711
02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:00,319
## what you're looking at and i need more




4712
02:36:00,319 --> 02:36:01,840
## data and more evidence




4713
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:05,760
## to even entertain the notion that uh




4714
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,359
## that it's going in the opposite




4715
02:36:07,359 --> 02:36:09,359
## direction in terms of the numbers




4716
02:36:09,359 --> 02:36:10,160
## however




4717
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:12,319
## in terms of public perception and the




4718
02:36:12,319 --> 02:36:14,080
## way that animal rights is perceived




4719
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,640
## publicly now animal rights has been




4720
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:18,319
## pushed even further back than it was




4721
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:20,800
## last year i do agree with that




4722
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:24,160
## yeah no totally i agree all right that




4723
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:25,760
## brings us to the end of my topics




4724
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:29,359
## um and now if you if you i guess it's




4725
02:36:29,359 --> 02:36:30,960
## late for you guys actually but if you do




4726
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:32,720
## have another like let's say let's limit




4727
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:33,840
## it to maybe like




4728
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:35,120
## i don't know would you agree for another




4729
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:37,200
## 20 minutes is that okay 30 minutes or is




4730
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:38,560
## that is that too much for you guys right




4731
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:39,359
## now




4732
02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:41,840
## 20 minutes sounds good all right i can




4733
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:44,000
## see




4734
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,520
## yeah i'm waking up and you're and you're




4735
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:47,359
## going to bed so this is kind of like




4736
02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:51,200
## yeah yeah how late is it sorry what time




4737
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:53,680
## 40. all right okay cool yeah we can




4738
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:55,120
## start to wrap up then so




4739
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:57,680
## um guys you got to put some questions in




4740
02:36:57,680 --> 02:36:58,240
## um




4741
02:36:58,240 --> 02:36:59,760
## i didn't see you putting any questions




4742
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:01,840
## in so far i'm not going to go back




4743
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:02,240
## through




4744
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:03,439
## all the way back to the beginning




4745
02:37:03,439 --> 02:37:04,399
## because i know some of you aren't even




4746
02:37:04,399 --> 02:37:06,080
## here anymore so if you've got questions




4747
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:06,880
## now's the time




4748
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:08,160
## and if you really really want your




4749
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:10,000
## question to be asked like right now and




4750
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,760
## you want it to make sure you fit it in




4751
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:13,439
## 20 minutes in the next 20 minutes then




4752
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:14,160
## you can uh




4753
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:16,560
## do a super chat and that will 100 be




4754
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:18,240
## asked as long as it's not




4755
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:20,640
## something shitty um to be to put it




4756
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:21,439
## bluntly




4757
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:23,920
## uh but yeah we're open to questions now




4758
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:25,200
## for the next like




4759
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:27,040
## 20 minutes or so but after that i'm




4760
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:30,319
## going to let them go to bed so




4761
02:37:30,319 --> 02:37:33,040
## i'm going to run to the toilet go go no




4762
02:37:33,040 --> 02:37:34,399
## worries




4763
02:37:34,399 --> 02:37:37,120
## no worries and whilst whilst waiting for




4764
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:38,640
## that yeah i just want to say i do




4765
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:39,920
## really appreciate you both coming on




4766
02:37:39,920 --> 02:37:41,600
## here i know it's it's mentally




4767
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:43,600
## exhausting to go through these things




4768
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:45,760
## um especially considering that some of




4769
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:46,880
## them are really ugly




4770
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:49,760
## accusations right um i've i've the




4771
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:51,200
## reason one of the main reasons i wanted




4772
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,640
## to do it as well is because i feel like




4773
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:53,280
## i can




4774
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,280
## empathize with this because i've also




4775
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:56,800
## been on the receiving end of equally




4776
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:58,479
## ugly accusations so i know




4777
02:37:58,479 --> 02:38:00,319
## i know how it feels when you read that




4778
02:38:00,319 --> 02:38:02,560
## like we all we all pretend like yeah




4779
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:02,880
## well




4780
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:04,880
## whatever you know whatever but like




4781
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:05,920
## really it does




4782
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:07,439
## it does get you right when you read




4783
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:09,120
## something so horrible and someone's




4784
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:10,399
## saying it about you




4785
02:38:10,399 --> 02:38:12,399
## i know how it feels so i'm happy we




4786
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:14,399
## could get through this and and you know




4787
02:38:14,399 --> 02:38:16,880
## i hope a few people have had uh i hope




4788
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:18,240
## it's given a few people something to




4789
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:19,760
## think about at least so they don't go




4790
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:20,479
## and




4791
02:38:20,479 --> 02:38:23,120
## repeat this nonsense uh over and over




4792
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:24,160
## again because it doesn't




4793
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,600
## it doesn't feel good to read it does it




4794
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:28,000
## you know




4795
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,560
## yeah i just hope that what people can




4796
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:31,520
## take from




4797
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:34,479
## this maybe is that they start thinking a




4798
02:38:34,479 --> 02:38:36,640
## bit more critically and if they hear




4799
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:38,960
## something they ask for evidence they ask




4800
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:40,080
## for proof




4801
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:43,200
## you know they look into it before




4802
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,080
## deciding that somebody is a racist




4803
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:47,280
## sexist etc




4804
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:49,120
## because these are horrible things that




4805
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:50,880
## you can say and




4806
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:54,080
## yeah i just it's sad that people can




4807
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:56,880
## just use this term so loosely now and




4808
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:57,920
## they don't realize




4809
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:01,520
## how insulting and destructive that is




4810
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:03,520
## and how much it actually takes away




4811
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:06,800
## from the real victims of these




4812
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:10,960
## um depression so yeah




4813
02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:14,720
## no for sure um




4814
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:16,000
## yeah i'm gonna be honest with you it




4815
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,200
## doesn't look like there's any questions




4816
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:18,479
## coming in i guess i guess we kind of




4817
02:39:18,479 --> 02:39:19,520
## answered so much




4818
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:21,120
## i guess they don't have any anything




4819
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:22,319
## else that's not being answered to be




4820
02:39:22,319 --> 02:39:24,000
## honest i thought about this earlier in




4821
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,680
## that we've gone through so many topics




4822
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:27,120
## that maybe there aren't going to be




4823
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:28,000
## questions




4824
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
## because there's like 60 people watching




4825
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,359
## right now and so far




4826
02:39:31,359 --> 02:39:33,520
## there's no questions so if that's the




4827
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:35,120
## case we can we can wrap up




4828
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:36,240
## there's a lot of statements though i can




4829
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:38,080
## put some of those on the screen you know




4830
02:39:38,080 --> 02:39:39,439
## just like for the last like maybe like




4831
02:39:39,439 --> 02:39:41,120
## 10 minutes or so just




4832
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:42,880
## being king saying here they don't have




4833
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:44,319
## evidence for their claims and when they




4834
02:39:44,319 --> 02:39:46,080
## do it's hilarious




4835
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:47,920
## i i mean this is how it seems to be




4836
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:50,000
## right that they there's no evidence or




4837
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:50,800
## there is




4838
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:53,280
## evidence but it's not evidence like it's




4839
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,040
## something they have made a




4840
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:56,399
## i don't know they've made it some kind




4841
02:39:56,399 --> 02:39:58,399
## of assumption from or they've twisted




4842
02:39:58,399 --> 02:39:59,200
## right




4843
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:01,760
## yeah this seems to be happening most of
