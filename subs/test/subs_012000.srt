2403
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,679
## to us and that was our response because




2404
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,280
## something like that 100 takes away from




2405
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,120
## what we're doing because it's




2406
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,920
## not necessary and it's irrelevant so to




2407
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,440
## put time aside




2408
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,679
## 15 20 minutes for everyone to go around




2409
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:17,840
## and say my name is blah blah blah and




2410
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,760
## this is my preferred pronoun




2411
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,639
## which is unnecessary because in case we




2412
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:23,760
## need to refer to you




2413
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,000
## you let us know then if we got it wrong




2414
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,080
## you correct us that's fine we can get on




2415
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,120
## with our day




2416
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,280
## um i know that that was something that




2417
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,480
## was brought up and i just wanted to




2418
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,280
## clarify that




2419
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,000
## there are many other things that are




2420
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,679
## human-centric




2421
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,920
## that we don't allocate




2422
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,400
## our activism our time to at the cubes




2423
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,159
## to engaging in and so you could use this




2424
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,000
## same logic if you're claiming




2425
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,360
## that we are discriminatory towards




2426
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,719
## those who have uh




2427
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,480
## again we've never even spoken about




2428
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,920
## trans people so i reject




2429
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,159
## the notion of even commenting on trans




2430
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,040
## people




2431
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,320
## people with gender pronouns uh the same




2432
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,800
## argument could be used




2433
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,480
## for uh not um honoring the custodians of




2434
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,560
## the land and saying something about like




2435
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,239
## the original custodians the land the




2436
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,679
## aboriginals or




2437
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,840
## or the native americans depending on the




2438
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
## of the region that we're talking about




2439
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,320
## here




2440
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,920
## we don't do that at the cubes either




2441
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,520
## does that mean that we are also




2442
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,840
## racist or we're also colo colon




2443
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,239
## colonialists




2444
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,239
## or whatever the word is that's being




2445
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,520
## tossed around regarding that




2446
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,639
## discrimination




2447
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,600
## no of course not because we're there for




2448
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,360
## non-humans and non-humans deserve a




2449
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,040
## cause dedicated to them that's what this




2450
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,080
## comes down to




2451
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,920
## is if you think that we're being




2452
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,920
## discriminatory




2453
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,480
## under that logic then you really just




2454
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,080
## don't think that animals deserve a cause




2455
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,520
## solely dedicated to them




2456
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,040
## that's what we're disagreeing about yeah




2457
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,000
## yeah i guess i guess my my what i'm what




2458
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,360
## i was trying to get out of it here is




2459
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,920
## try to get to clarify what for 100 this




2460
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,520
## which i think you have clarified now




2461
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,239
## is that like the the you know what you




2462
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,440
## don't want people you don't want to




2463
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,320
## bring up




2464
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,360
## um like let's say




2465
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,760
## identity politics into into cubing you




2466
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,199
## don't want it to become part of




2467
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,199
## av you don't want it to become part of




2468
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,120
## an action or an event




2469
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,719
## um however if somebody has personal




2470
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,880
## a personal thing where they want to be




2471
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,159
## referred to as




2472
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,159
## a certain pronoun or they've recently




2473
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,199
## transitioned




2474
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,520
## that av is part of av policies to




2475
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,360
## respect that because not respecting that




2476
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,040
## would be considered bullying




2477
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,320
## that's what i'm trying to clarify here




2478
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,679
## so this is you're making a distinction




2479
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:40,880
## between the two




2480
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,880
## i also need to make the distinction here




2481
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:43,920
## that




2482
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,800
## we're referring to sex if anything




2483
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,040
## whenever the word gender is being used




2484
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,480
## in this conversation




2485
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,400
## we are not referring to anything other




2486
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,920
## than sex




2487
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,760
## we are not referring our repeat to




2488
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,000
## anything other than sex




2489
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,920
## and the conversation keeps getting




2490
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,760
## skewed by others




2491
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,360
## to be referring to gender but uh




2492
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,760
## regarding trans issues or regarding this




2493
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:08,800
## whole thing




2494
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,719
## uh with my comments on being skeptical




2495
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:13,920
## of gender pronouns




2496
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,840
## it was regarding sex that i was




2497
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,440
## skeptical of this




2498
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,120
## there aren't more than two sexes in my




2499
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,120
## opinion and i think that people are




2500
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,880
## entitled to have that opinion




2501
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,560
## trans people are transitioning between




2502
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,239
## those two sexes i think they have the




2503
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:27,360
## right to do that




2504
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,679
## so i support the trans movement if




2505
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:30,880
## that's what it is right




2506
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,199
## i have trans people that follow me that




2507
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:34,960
## support me that like me




2508
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,440
## in the face of my comments and the hate




2509
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,800
## i receive




2510
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,120
## getting called a transfer does not waver




2511
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,000
## these people




2512
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,600
## i'm not trying to use them as a token




2513
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,120
## i'm just giving people context




2514
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,760
## because context is lost in our in our




2515
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,120
## culture




2516
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,719
## and yeah that's all i have to say




2517
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,000
## okay um




2518
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,520
## yeah yes i'm trying to wrap my head




2519
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,880
## around it and also i just sorry i was




2520
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,080
## just taking care of a troll




2521
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,760
## as well i'm just asking annie to get rid




2522
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,199
## of a troll in the chat as i was also




2523
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,400
## trying to get that sword it




2524
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,040
## seems like they're bothering people so




2525
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:09,440
## you




2526
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,679
## obviously you make a separation between




2527
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:12,560
## um




2528
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,440
## sex and gender which i think most well i




2529
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,000
## mean that's just




2530
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,920
## that's that's scientific um there is




2531
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,520
## there is actually i think




2532
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,520
## um some people would argue including




2533
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,120
## myself that there are three sexes




2534
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,239
## because there's intersex




2535
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,159
## which is very rare but it exists right




2536
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,159
## it's it's when someone's born with




2537
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,280
## both or like like you know both um




2538
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,880
## genetics or whatever i don't know too




2539
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,639
## much about it but i know that it exists




2540
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:35,360
## um




2541
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,960
## and then yeah and then and then you're




2542
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,360
## drawing the line because because um




2543
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,080
## yeah because genders it's a new it is an




2544
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,480
## ideology the ideology gender ideology is




2545
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,360
## new it is new




2546
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,199
## if anyone's upset about this then i'm




2547
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,639
## not sorry because you need to do some




2548
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,000
## research on this and how




2549
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,760
## realize how gender ideology is a very




2550
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,840
## recent thing and it hasn't been put




2551
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,719
## through




2552
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,679
## uh the rigorous testing that most other




2553
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:58,560
## psychological




2554
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,360
## and scientific you know concepts have
