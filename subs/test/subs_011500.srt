697
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,760
## also throwing those animals onto the ice every 
## time they score a goal and he was going nuts  




698
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,600
## and then the radio guy said whoa gary chill 
## chill what did you have for dinner last night  




699
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,080
## and then gary was like a salad




700
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:24,880
## and it was that moment that he realized that no 
## other answer could have been acceptable and the  




701
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:31,280
## hypocrisy was what got gary yourofsky to go vegan 
## that night he said was the night that he went  




702
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:37,280
## vegan i heard stories about the elephant story 
## in michigan he talked about a circus incident and  




703
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:43,520
## then there was this other incident but it wasn't 
## that he was going to thorn apple valley pig farm  




704
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:48,560
## in in michigan and seeing pigs being slaughtered 
## every day he kept going and witnessing he couldn't  




705
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:54,880
## believe that this was going on he hadn't gone 
## vegan until that guy said you're a hypocrite




706
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:05,120
## so please understand how powerful that is even the 
## best activists that we know of the most effective  




707
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,760
## this is what caused them to go vegan it's 
## the same thing for me it's the same exact  




708
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:16,400
## story for me when i realized from listening to 
## gary that i was a hypocrite if i wasn't vegan  




709
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:22,320
## and there's no way you can justify 
## even a little bit of animal consumption  




710
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,840
## that's when i became vegan but prior to that i 
## was bullshitting i was plant-based i would eat  




711
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,080
## salmon sometimes i'd wear leather i was 
## raw vegan while wearing leather jackets  




712
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:39,520
## i could take you through a typical interaction 
## if you'd like from start to end would you like  




713
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,560
## that yeah yep so we start the conversation 
## by would you like to know why we're here  




714
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,560
## they need to say something affirmative for the 
## conversation to go ahead they either say yes or  




715
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:56,960
## they try to guess and that's an affirmative answer 
## so you continue yes what we're doing here is we're  




716
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,760
## showing the standard practice footage of what 
## happens in the meat dairy in egg industries and  




717
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:09,040
## other industries that abuse animals and we're also 
## showing free-range grass-fed organic cage-free  




718
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:16,080
## humane certified hey guys would you like to know 
## why we're here i'm guessing against animal cruelty  




719
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:22,800
## that is a good guess what we're showing on 
## the screens is the animal industries meat  




720
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,400
## dairy and eggs and other industries also that 
## abuse animals for products would you like to  




721
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:34,000
## hear what we're doing here um sure cool yes what 
## we're doing is we're showing the behind the scenes  




722
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:39,920
## of industries that abuse animals so this is in 
## the meat industry dairy industry egg industry  




723
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,800
## we're showing is also the best of the best so 
## this is free range cage free humane certified  




724
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,720
## all right would you like to hear what we're doing 
## here yes what we're doing is we're showing the  




725
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:58,640
## behind the scenes of industries that abuse animals 
## like meat dairy eggs leather the next question you  




726
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:05,360
## have to ask them is how do you feel about animal 
## abuse usually they say well it's obviously wrong  




727
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:11,360
## 100 against it that's what they usually say 
## people say okay so you think this is wrong  




728
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:15,600
## would you say this is evil this is me doubling 
## down to make sure i've owned them on this point  




729
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:22,880
## would you say this is evil would you say that 
## this is evil yes treating animals like our slaves  




730
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:30,000
## yeah would you say that stabbing animals to 
## death for a sandwich is wrong yeah yeah yeah  




731
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,040
## that's hard what are your initial thoughts how 
## does this kind of stuff make you guys feel guilty




732
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:44,160
## yeah so it's safe to say that you guys are 
## against animal abuse yeah for sure i want you  




733
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:52,400
## all right i just want to clarify that again there 
## was an update here that we've made um i don't  




734
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:57,360
## think that closed-ended questions are actually as 
## effective as open-ended questions in this segment  




735
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,920
## of the interaction so instead of saying do you 
## think stabbing an animal to death for a sandwich  




736
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,800
## or torturing animals to death is evil 
## do you think that's evil do you think  




737
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,680
## that's wrong it's a closed-ended 
## question it's an obvious question  




738
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:16,800
## it's in fact more important for you to say how do 
## you feel about animal abuse and then when they say  




739
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:24,320
## i feel guilty i feel horrible it's terrible and 
## then the next thing you need to do to just confirm  




740
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:29,520
## their position on animal abuse is to say is it 
## safe to say that you are against animal abuse  




741
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:35,840
## and in in some circumstances i might even 
## triple down and say would you say it's evil  




742
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,520
## so you need to ask that open-ended question 
## first and then the closed-ended question  




743
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,280
## just to confirm and seal it off now 
## that will make sense why you need to  




744
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,840
## do that as i continue on with the approach 
## here showing you the step-by-step process




745
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:57,680
## the footage how does it make you feel it makes 
## me cringe cringe why do you think it makes you  




746
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:04,320
## feel that way because i love the animals you love 
## animals interesting so safe to say you're against
