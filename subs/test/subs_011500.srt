2244
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,199
## but at the same time forcing others to




2245
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,719
## believe what you believe at the cube is




2246
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:05,760
## not welcome




2247
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,280
## that's not what we're there for right




2248
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,840
## everybody has a different belief system




2249
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,520
## when it comes to this topic




2250
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,040
## and people are entitled to have




2251
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,719
## different opinions about this




2252
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,239
## and that's it's not a time and a space




2253
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,760
## at a cube of truth




2254
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,040
## to be fighting each other to be engaging




2255
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,000
## in this kind of




2256
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,040
## discord when it's human-centric




2257
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,480
## and we are supposed to be there for




2258
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,320
## non-human animals we should be




2259
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,920
## respecting each other to have the right




2260
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,440
## to have a different opinion




2261
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,040
## and to just get on with the one thing




2262
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,320
## we're supposed to be on the same page




2263
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:38,800
## about




2264
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,360
## which is non-human animal rights deserve




2265
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,080
## to have




2266
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,080
## this three or four hours dedicated to




2267
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,120
## them on the streets




2268
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,760
## yeah i guess i guess to kind of close




2269
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,320
## this off




2270
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,600
## or i hope we can close it off as if




2271
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,920
## so if if uh we have i mean obviously




2272
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,120
## there are there are obviously trans




2273
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,640
## activists right i'm focusing on trans




2274
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,679
## here because i understand what you're




2275
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,920
## saying about gender pronouns in that




2276
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,239
## if somebody has chosen a pronoun because




2277
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:05,120
## it's




2278
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,159
## whatever it's something they want to




2279
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,760
## identify as i understand why there's




2280
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,159
## some




2281
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,840
## some skepticism here because it's kind




2282
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,840
## of like all right that's fine




2283
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,000
## you'll go ahead and do that and people




2284
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,199
## can respect that but if




2285
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:18,640
## if they forget or if they




2286
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,800
## i don't know if they don't want to and




2287
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,719
## there's no real logic behind the reason




2288
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:24,159
## that the view identifying is that i can




2289
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,199
## understand why someone




2290
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,040
## you know not being into that but where




2291
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,880
## i'm specifically focusing on here




2292
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,040
## and and i'm focusing on it because it is




2293
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,719
## it is medical it is it is it is a




2294
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,400
## psychological thing it is not something




2295
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,040
## that's like




2296
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,880
## opinion is that you know gender




2297
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,880
## dysphoria exists like trans people exist




2298
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,199
## we have to




2299
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,320
## time but now it's becoming more




2300
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,920
## acceptable to discuss it right




2301
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,760
## so you see a lot more people who are




2302
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,679
## coming out this way whereas in the past




2303
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:50,719
## they wouldn't have done they would have




2304
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,000
## hidden it because they were embarrassed




2305
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,199
## or ashamed and they just go through




2306
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,480
## their whole life with this




2307
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,159
## situation you know with this this




2308
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,080
## problem nowadays uh people are




2309
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,600
## being encouraged to speak up about it




2310
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,360
## and you know go public and get the




2311
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,239
## operation and




2312
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:03,760
## and re-identify themselves so that




2313
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,239
## they're more they are who they are right




2314
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:09,280
## what i'm trying to get here is that does




2315
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,920
## does av have like uh something in place




2316
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,920
## that is also accommodating that




2317
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,920
## so that so that if somebody does come to




2318
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,920
## a cube as a trans person




2319
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,760
## um and they want to be identified as a




2320
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,960
## he um or




2321
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,320
## she or they if they're not sure um




2322
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,280
## and somebody is is you know if they get




2323
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,040
## it wrong by accident okay i get that




2324
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,159
## that's something that you know




2325
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:31,520
## it shouldn't if it's a complaint you




2326
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,760
## just say okay hey please you know don't




2327
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,199
## don't get it wrong by accident in the




2328
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:36,880
## future like do us a favor but if if




2329
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,040
## they're choosing to get it wrong




2330
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,640
## if they're like actually saying no i




2331
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,320
## don't accept that




2332
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,800
## are you saying that yeah bullying yeah




2333
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,560
## that could that could be bullying yeah




2334
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,560
## um but also i kind of i'm kind of trying




2335
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,080
## to understand where the line's drawn




2336
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,920
## between well that's your ideology so




2337
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,719
## tough [ __ ]




2338
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:54,960
## versus well okay no this is something




2339
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,800
## that this is you this is who you are




2340
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,640
## and look this person needs to respect




2341
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,320
## that or or they're the one that'll




2342
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,679
## be kicked out like where are you where




2343
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,360
## are you drawing the line between the




2344
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,360
## ideology versus the bullying if you




2345
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,800
## understand what i'm saying




2346
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,719
## because maybe an organizer says well i




2347
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,000
## don't need to respect that because i




2348
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,040
## don't agree




2349
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,840
## where's the line drawn




2350
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,560
## the line is simply drawn at if the




2351
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,719
## interaction at the cube requires your




2352
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,480
## gender




2353
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,960
## then okay we'll use whatever gender you




2354
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,640
## choose us to use




2355
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,800
## however whatever name because in that




2356
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,040
## case they can also use the name if the




2357
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,640
## organizer or the volunteer




2358
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,120
## feels uncomfortable or they don't align




2359
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,800
## with the same ideologies




2360
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,159
## they don't have to use the pronoun they




2361
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,159
## can just refer to them with their chosen




2362
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:38,960
## name




2363
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,640
## yeah that's what i was going to say is




2364
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,960
## that the interactions the cube don't




2365
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,320
## actually require




2366
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,719
## don't actually require the gender so




2367
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:48,480
## that's what i was saying is that




2368
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,480
## if i'm trying to be charitable and




2369
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,840
## open-minded here by saying




2370
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,000
## if there is a circumstance of the cube




2371
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,280
## that requires the gender and the




2372
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,120
## interaction to be successful




2373
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,640
## in the communication sure no not using




2374
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,719
## that would be rude it would be bullying




2375
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,560
## and when there's no case at a cube of




2376
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,320
## truth




2377
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,600
## where this has happened we're with




2378
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,360
## bullied people and said




2379
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,199
## [ __ ] your beliefs that's never happened




2380
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,800
## it's just ridiculous to even suggest




2381
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,480
## that that has happened




2382
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,280
## but you know but it's not required




2383
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,800
## that's what we're saying




2384
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,840
## it's not required it's it's yeah this




2385
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,080
## this notion that it is required is a new




2386
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,239
## notion that's being brought into a b




2387
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:29,440
## it's never been required and um i




2388
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,760
## i think i know something that was




2389
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,560
## brought up




2390
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,920
## a while ago was um people are suggesting




2391
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,120
## that




2392
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,880
## at the start of the cube because we do a




2393
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,679
## briefing right when everyone's there




2394
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,440
## getting ready to do the cube




2395
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,400
## somebody or maybe a few people suggested




2396
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:48,880
## that




2397
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,120
## we do this like we go around and get




2398
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,159
## people to




2399
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:55,600
## introduce themselves and choose their




2400
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,520
## preferred like announce their preferred




2401
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,960
## pronoun and this




2402
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,960
## is something that brought was brought up
