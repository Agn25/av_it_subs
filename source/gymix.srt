1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,480
all right in 2013 i went vegan as a result of 
watching the georgia tech speech by gary yourofsky  

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,440
and this gentleman's also responsible for 
inspiring me to become the most effective  

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,079
animal rights activist that i can be and 
has really changed the game for me in many  

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,200
ways and i think has shaken up the world with 
his speeches so i think it's only right that  

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,560
i give back myself and my team have put together 
this video it is the best of the best what we  

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,600
think is the creme de la creme of gary yourofsky's 
speeches and other moments in his activism  

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,080
all right good afternoon everybody my name is 
gary yourofsky please take a moment and jot down  

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,680
my email address and my website in case you want 
to contact me later on today we're going to talk  

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:54,240
about the world's forgotten victims animals and 
the world's oldest and strongest addiction meat  

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,120
i'm going to challenge your belief systems today 
so certain parts of the speech will be intense  

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,240
but let me start with a quick disclaimer 
i am not here to be your enemy the views  

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,680
expressed today do not necessarily reflect the 
views of your professor or this institution  

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:22,720
i am not trying to take you away from your 
religion no religion mandates meat eating  

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:32,720
the golden rule states do unto others as you would 
have done unto yourself animals qualify as others  

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:42,080
and thou shalt not kill the four most important 
yet most ignored words in all religious teachings  

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,160
there's not an asterisk next to that commandment 
saying unless you walk on all fours have fur  

17
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,640
feathers horns beaks or gills you can keep 
your friends your politics and your patriotism  

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,840
still watch your favorite tv shows and listen to 
your favorite music even if it's ted nugent i'll  

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,840
be making some sarcastic yet truthful comments 
throughout the speech please feel free to laugh  

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,720
while i'm being sarcastic just don't laugh 
during the serious parts now i'm going to  

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,480
speak for around 65 maybe 70 minutes but then 
we'll do a q a session after for about a half  

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,880
an hour so hold your questions until then in the 
meantime i have some rhetorical questions for you  

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:36,160
is slavery owner victim profit domination 
exclusive to the human race have blacks  

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,440
jews women and children been the only victims 
of this atrocity have not cows been enslaved  

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,880
what about pigs chickens turkeys fish sheep if 
they're not enslaved then what are they free  

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:02,800
can slavery have a victim that is neither human 
nor animal have not the oceans the forest the  

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:11,440
earth itself become victims of ownership too and 
what about a slaughterhouse house of slaughter  

28
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:20,000
slaughterhouse do you really think there's such 
a thing as humane slaughter exactly what is your  

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,560
definition of humane besides psychological 
and physical abuse torture dismemberment  

30
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,960
and murder what else do you think happens to 
animals inside of a slaughterhouse you think  

31
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,200
they get belly rubs and tushy slaps and if you 
think there's such a thing as humane slaughter  

32
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,800
i'm curious do you also think there's such a 
thing as humane rape humane child molestation  

33
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:57,200
humane slavery about a humane holocaust in 
fact what is your definition of a holocaust  

34
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,280
is it a massacre of human beings 
or a massacre of innocent beings  

35
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,960
i thought it was innocent which brings us to the 
biggest holocaust massacre of all every year in  

36
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:23,920
america without mercy we murder 10 billion land 
animals and 18 billion marine animals not for  

37
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:31,520
health survival sustenance or self-defense people 
eat meat cheese milk and eggs for four reasons  

38
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:41,680
habit tradition convenience taste i want 
to define a word that might be new to  

39
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
some people right now and it's vegan 
it's up there on the screen v-e-g-a-n

40
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:57,040
vegans like vegetarians do not consume the meat 
of any land or marine animal vegans however  

41
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:06,240
unlike vegetarians also refrain from eating cheese 
milk eggs honey or any animal product whatsoever  

42
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,640
we also don't wear animal skins no fur leather 
wool silk or down now i want to let you all know  

43
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:22,240
that i was not raised vegan i ate meat cheese 
milk and eggs for around 25 years i used to wear  

44
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,120
leather shoes and belts and jackets like everyone 
else in fact around 20 years ago i even owned  

45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,360
a fur coat needless to say i understand your 
lifestyle it used to be mine and for people  

46
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:46,960
involved in politics let's get this out of the 
way right now i am not a democrat an anarchist  

47
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,920
or some hippie with a closet full of tie dye 
shirts i'm not a republican a socialist or a  

48
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:02,720
fascist i'm an activist root word is active 
i've been banned from five countries so far  

49
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,600
and arrested 13 times for random acts of kindness 
and compassion on behalf of my animal brothers  

50
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,520
and sisters if you want to read up about that 
check out my website and today i would love to  

51
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,440
give you a chance to actually do something and 
truly get involved because i understand a lot of  

52
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,320
people want to get involved honestly i do but 
putting a co-exist bumper sticker on your car  

53
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,680
wearing a what would jesus do bracelet or 
sporting a peace and love and sunshine t-shirt  

54
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,360
that is not getting involved i understand 
that we're all on a journey in life  

55
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,000
we all have different likes and dislikes 
different nationalities and religions  

56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,080
too but there's one thing that we need to have in 
common with each other and that's peace contrary  

57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:03,600
to political and religious dogma animals do not 
belong to us they are not commodities they're not  

58
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:11,680
property and they're not inanimate stupid objects 
who can't think and feel that descartes cartesian  

59
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:20,800
way of looking at animals like their machines it 
is outdated and quite frankly 100 percent insane  

60
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:31,440
because if we all understand that animals can 
use their eyes to see ears to hear noses to smell  

61
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:42,480
mouths to eat legs to walk feathers to fly fins to 
swim genitalia to procreate bowels to defecate i'm  

62
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,240
always perplexed and most people don't believe 
that they can also use their brains to think  

63
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,200
feel be rational be aware and be 
self-aware am i supposed to believe  

64
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,200
that every body part on an animal 
functions just like it's supposed to  

65
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:09,680
except the brain those lies are thick the 
propaganda from the animal abusers is enormous  

66
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,440
i mean when was the last time you turned on 
tv and saw a commercial for shiitake mushrooms  

67
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,600
people singing and dancing down the streets having 
a good time eating mushrooms about alfalfa sprouts  

68
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:36,720
quinoa it's a seed radishes raspberries tofu you 
don't see that stuff advertised on tv what do you  

69
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,440
see instead have some more meat have some more 
cheese have some more cheese on your meat meat  

70
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,560
cheese double cheese extra cheese and how about a 
little more cheese with your meat have some more  

71
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,080
cow's milk have some more eggs and then what do 
you see interspersed between those advertisements  

72
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,160
not feeling so well need to see a cancer 
specialist how about a heart doctor need some  

73
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:06,160
lipitor zocor crestor plavix needs some diet pills 
how about some energy drinks some k.o pectate

74
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:20,080
you've been duped and those blinders are on nice 
and tightly but if you give me an open mind today  

75
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,560
that's all i ask for an open mind i'm going to 
take your blinders right up my goal is simple  

76
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,000
all i want to do is reconnect people with animals 
awaken some emotions and some feelings and some  

77
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,280
logic that has been buried and suppressed 
intentionally by our society and the reason  

78
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,600
why i say reconnect it's because each and 
every person in this room used to be a real  

79
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,960
animal rights person at one time a true animal 
lover and a real friend of the animal kingdom  

80
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,080
and it's when we were kids when we were young 
we were kids man we used to be in all animals

81
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,720
they used to make us laugh and giggle and 
smile they made us pretty happy and there was  

82
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,960
a time in our lives when we would do just about 
anything in the world to make them happy as well  

83
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,640
to protect them from cruelty or to at least 
acknowledge the cruelty they were receiving  

84
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,160
i mean if somebody was mean to an animal 
in front of us when we were little  

85
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,280
we would have screamed and cried and that's 
because we all used to understand right from  

86
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:37,440
wrong when it came to the treatment of animals 
until somebody told us and taught us differently  

87
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,400
you better believe somebody told us to ignore 
their suffering to mock and excuse their pain and  

88
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,880
their misery to make fun of their very existence 
and this is something i want you to focus on today  

89
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:58,960
tomorrow and beyond what in the hell happened 
along the way who taught us to be so mean  

90
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,200
and nasty and vicious and hateful or indifferent 
towards animals when they used to be our friends  

91
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,800
these are innocent beings who have done nothing 
wrong to us because i'm pretty sure we can all  

92
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:21,600
agree in at least one thing right now that hatred 
in its purest form is a learned behavior racism  

93
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:30,720
sexism heterosexism anti-semitism misogyny these 
are all learned behaviors when kids are two three  

94
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,280
four years old playing on a playground they could 
care less about the color of their friend's skin  

95
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,160
or their religious background i don't think 
there's any doubt that hatred in its purest  

96
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,360
form is learned so speciesism is no different 
this could be a new word to a lot of people  

97
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,800
it's up here on the screen right below vegan 
the word species with an ism attached to it  

98
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,960
and i want to define this word as the unethical 
on principled point of view that the human  

99
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:10,720
species has every right to exploit 
enslave and murder another species  

100
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:18,480
and all because we believe that our species is 
so more special so more superior than the other  

101
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,360
ones we're the only ones that count and we're the 
only ones that matter now correct me if i'm wrong

102
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:36,160
but that line of thinking that thought process 
that is the basis of all forms of discrimination  

103
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,040
one group saying and thinking they're more special 
than everyone else and they proceed to exploit  

104
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,280
them oppress them denying them their right to be 
free they treat them like property they enslave  

105
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:53,440
them in many cases and in many other cases 
they murder them with premeditation and without  

106
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,120
penalty and understand something essential about 
discrimination it is never okay to be picking and  

107
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,240
choosing which forms of discrimination to be 
opposed to which ones to say are evil racism  

108
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,120
and which ones to say are okay speciesism 
discrimination is evil on its foundation  

109
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,560
or it's not you cannot have this one both ways it 
doesn't work like that i want to ask you to use  

110
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,440
some empathy right now and when i say empathy what 
i'm saying is is place yourself in the position  

111
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,400
of the animals and start to view this issue from 
the animal's point of view from the victim's point  

112
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:45,040
of view when you examine any form of injustice 
whether humans are victims or animals or victims  

113
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:52,880
please remember the victim's point of view if you 
are not the victim don't examine it entirely from  

114
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,640
your point of view because when you're not the 
victim it becomes pretty easy to rationalize and  

115
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:08,160
excuse cruelty injustice inequality slavery 
and even murder but when you're the victim

116
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,680
things look a lot differently from that 
anger now i want to show a do you ever wonder  

117
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,080
why mcdonald's and burger king and wendy's 
never show you those images in their tv ads  

118
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,160
instead they show you smiling cartoon 
caricatures of animals singing and  

119
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:33,840
dancing and playing lying to you 
brainwashing you programming you  

120
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,720
not to care about things you would normally 
care about things that you used to care about

121
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:52,480
right now at this very moment on american highways 
there are no less than 5 000 concentration camp  

122
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:03,280
trucks trucks that we've constructed inside these 
trucks there are living terrified innocent beings  

123
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:12,160
cows and pigs and chickens these trucks are being 
driven to concentration camp slaughterhouses  

124
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,960
that we've carefully constructed all across 
america when the trucks arrive the animals are  

125
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:27,120
so frightened they won't even get off the truck 
they're not stupid they know what's next so people  

126
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,840
go on the trucks with electric prods and force 
them to walk down the chutes to their own death  

127
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,280
or if the animals are small enough to manhandle 
like chickens we'll just grab them off the trucks  

128
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:46,320
and toss them inside inside these innocent living 
beings are hanged upside down fully conscious  

129
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,240
in other words they go in alive against their will 
and come out chopped up into hundreds of pieces  

130
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:07,120
but you know what's more insane than that meat 
eaters walking around like their lifestyle isn't  

131
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:16,560
causing any harm like it's normal and natural 
to be consuming violence and death how would you  

132
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:25,120
feel if the day that you were born somebody else 
had already planned the day of your execution

133
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,360
that's what it's like to be a cow a pig a 
chicken or a turkey on this planet i think  

134
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,720
i think this type of behavior is inexcusable an 
unbecoming of a species that claims to understand  

135
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:51,600
right from wrong the animals have not done 
one single thing to us to deserve the wrath  

136
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,120
and the cruelty that we hurl on them and i hope 
you all understand what i'm offering you today  

137
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,840
when you hit the door after my speech are 
you aware that for the first time ever  

138
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:11,040
you can now directly participate in ending a 
massacre instead of sitting around and paying  

139
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,560
lip service to all the massacres and all the 
problems that are always going on on this planet  

140
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:23,440
what is so frustrating to me when i travel this 
country doing around 250 lectures every year to  

141
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:31,840
some 7 500 students is that everybody talks a good 
game i've noticed that people are quite the smooth  

142
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:40,240
talkers when it comes to peace and compassion i 
mean people always want to tell me never show me  

143
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,440
just tell me how peaceful they are because of 
what they believe in or what makes them sad  

144
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,120
hey gary i believe in god and i believe in angels 
and i pray all the time and those earthquakes the  

145
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:02,640
one in chile and haiti oh that was so sad and no [ 
__ ] it was sad since when does feeling sad about  

146
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,960
an obvious tragedy or believing in something 
make the world a better place or make somebody  

147
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,360
a good person and listen folks i am not trying 
to dog you out when i talk like this i'm not  

148
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,960
i'm just not a politician i'm not a [ __ ] artist 
i don't know how to schmooze people as you can see  

149
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,200
it's kind of beyond me i hope you appreciate my 
honesty and my genuineness today and i'm not a  

150
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,880
salesperson i got no books to sell you after my 
lecture no dvds and no documentaries no collection  

151
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,520
plate going around i don't want your money i 
don't want your email addresses and i don't want  

152
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,120
your mailing addresses keep all that stuff i am 
here to talk about the worst form of cruelty and  

153
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,440
violence taking place on this planet even though 
most people don't seem to care about it but when  

154
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,520
you sit back in the comfort of your living room 
and you start condemning atrocities elsewhere  

155
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:09,040
that is pure unadulterated lip service that's the 
definition of lip service but veganism this is now  

156
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,720
a chance to actually walk the compassionate 
talk that everybody's always talking about  

157
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,280
this is your chance to show others how truly 
peaceful you are this is a chance for a personal  

158
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:29,760
revolution to leave your mark on this planet by 
causing the least amount of harm possible always  

159
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:37,840
being vegan now come on what's the argument 
for not causing the least amount of harm  

160
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:48,160
inconvenience indifference apathy selfishness 
i want you to know i don't live in fantasyland

161
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,040
i'm well aware that animals 
are suffering and dying  

162
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,160
just because we're here on the planet with 
them we build homes through their habitat we  

163
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,920
pollute their environment destroy their habitat is 
there a reason we have to maximize the suffering  

164
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,200
and maximize the cruelty and the 
death that they already endure  

165
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,840
by eating them on top of it all you want to talk 
about pouring salt into somebody else's womb  

166
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:30,000
98 and i repeat this stat 98 of animals who are 
abused and killed on this planet are abused and  

167
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,600
killed by the meat dairy and egg industries 
this is where all the harm is taking place and  

168
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,680
in america from birth until death each meat eater 
consumes around 3 000 land animals and thousands  

169
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:53,120
of other marine animals those are usda stats 
now with all this being said we've established  

170
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,080
the four reasons why people eat meat cheese 
milk and eggs no debating no discussing them

171
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:09,680
have it tradition convenience taste it now 
i want to get back to taste good though  

172
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,560
because i think meat tastes great it might shock 
you to hear me say that but if you're doing some  

173
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,440
kind of extra credit essay on my speech you 
want to quote me quote me right now i love  

174
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:32,560
the way meat tastes love it cheese love it 
cow's milk and eggs love it guilty as charged  

175
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:41,520
i did not stop eating this stuff because of 
the taste issue i stopped for ethics morality  

176
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,480
decency how come when i talk about mock meat i 
always catch a handful of people in every crowd  

177
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,960
and we got a big crowd today so i stopped counting 
at about eight or nine how come there's always a  

178
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,920
handful of people that wrinkle up their noses make 
big wide eyes and start glancing at the people  

179
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,360
next to them across the aisle like soy chicken 
is this guy crazy soy bacon he must be out of his  

180
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:14,640
mind how come this stuff that is made of soy wheat 
vegetables grains and spices contrary to the lies  

181
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,080
being spread about these products by the meat and 
dairy industries how come this stuff is considered  

182
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,160
gross to most people but meat meat's got five 
components let me break it down for you blood  

183
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,680
flesh veins muscles and tendons the cut up 
corpse of a dismembered body how does meat  

184
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,720
not qualify as gross and disgusting everybody 
how in the world is a beverage a liquid that  

185
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,680
oozes out of the others of cows a secretion that 
drips from the mammary glands of another being  

186
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,360
that's loaded with pus by the way oh yeah let 
me tell you how the pus in your child milk it'd  

187
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,720
be my pleasure when you hook machines up to the 
others of cows three times a day to suck them dry  

188
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,280
those machines cause massive amounts of infections 
on the inside and outside of the utter now let's  

189
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,960
add all the bovine growth hormone they put in cows 
to make sure they produce huge quantities of milk  

190
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,920
which always leads to another infection the 
machine doesn't know what not to suck out  

191
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,720
pus mucus and infections right in with your 
milk and yeah milk is pasteurized but when did  

192
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:30,400
pasteurization become a removal process it's a 
sanitation process you're only sanitizing pus  

193
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,040
and you want to look this up online you 
don't think the dairy industry would ever  

194
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,960
use the word pus when they write about 
this problem in their own trade journals  

195
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,200
and they're going to deceive you again with 
this look up the scientific term for pus  

196
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,680
somatic cell count and by the way our 
government the usda they allow the dairy  

197
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:56,640
industry to have a maximum amount of one eye 
dropper full of pus in every glass another  

198
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,080
drink up does anybody know what an egg actually 
is from a hand and don't say embryo or aborted  

199
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,520
fetus not even close it's unfertilized so 
it can't be either hen is a female though  

200
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,800
unfertilized egg through a female system it's 
part of her menstruation cycle it's a hens  

201
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,400
period people scramble up hand periods in the 
morning and all of a sudden i'm weird because i  

202
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,240
don't make omelets anymore and what about vomit oh 
we're going to take those blinders off today come  

203
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,480
on you guys love vomit you adore it all over your 
food got you give this one a pretty name though

204
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:41,840
no one's gonna buy and eat vomit unless we call 
it honey instead honey comes directly from a  

205
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,760
bee's stomach it is regurgitated right through a 
bee's mouth look it up with any wildlife biologist  

206
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,320
but nobody wants to eat bee bonnet and 
nut cheerios we want honey nut cheerios  

207
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,360
so we hire ourselves to play euphemism games the 
standard diet of a meat eater is blood flesh veins  

208
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,640
muscles tendons cow secretions hen periods and b 
vomit now we're not done yet i am not going to let  

209
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,440
you off that easy while i got you here today 
you know we topped this all off in my opinion  

210
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:20,880
because every november during that certain holiday 
people love so much people take a dead turkey open  

211
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,640
up the dead turkey's ass or carve out a really big 
hole in their ass take some stuffing and shove it  

212
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,240
inside their dead empty ass and use their little 
dead ass as an oven to bake some bread somebody  

213
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:41,280
else's dead empty bacteria-laden ass to make 
bread ash bread and people think vegans are weird  

214
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:48,240
because we eat tofu and rice and beans and lentils 
i tell people one of my favorite meals nowadays  

215
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:57,760
yes boy dish me up a plate of yams for dinner 
and i'm a happy guy i know how most people are  

216
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,440
though i tell them this they're like but you just 
see amsterdam i don't know man it's kind of weird  

217
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,080
okay but somebody else's rib cage sitting 
on your plate isn't weird doesn't make you  

218
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,640
think twice severed legs sliced up thighs 
and mutilated breasts sitting on your plate  

219
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,840
doesn't make you think twice 
and you want to know why

220
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,720
those blinders are on nice and tightly 
aren't they and i bet most of you were  

221
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,240
perturbed in me when the speech began and 
i accused everybody of having blinders on  

222
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:49,520
i am not here to be your enemy i am here 
to call you out though you might have had a  

223
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:58,480
pretty good excuse before i got here of being 
uninformed and misinformed okay that's fair  

224
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:06,800
honestly well i was the same way for a long time 
i'm kind of curious though what's the excuse now

225
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,880
you got a choice today never to intentionally 
harm another animal for breakfast lunch or  

226
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,880
dinner ever again these creatures have 
never harmed you violated you or taken  

227
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,840
advantage of you in any way shape or form 
the least you can do is return the favor  

228
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:34,800
or you can stay radically cruel keep the status 
quo as is make sure animals have no freedom  

229
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,440
make sure they never experience one drop of human 
kindness make sure their babies are stolen from  

230
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,560
them make sure their beaks are sliced off their 
horns are cut off and their testicles ripped out  

231
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,880
make sure there's a knife in their throat every 
second of every day for eternity i really hope  

232
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,840
you'll make the right choice i want to wrap 
this speech up so we can do our q a session  

233
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,920
give me about six more minutes to say something on 
the dairy industry as it pertains directly to cows  

234
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,800
we talked about the pus in cow milk which is 
gross but we have yet to focus on what the cows  

235
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:19,200
are going through keep in mind veganism 
isn't about your health that would be selfish  

236
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,000
i'm trying to get people to 
be unselfish for a change to  

237
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,840
be altruistic and when you do that 
don't expect something in return  

238
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,520
but when it comes to cruelty i think there's 
more cruelty in a glass of milk than a steak  

239
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:42,880
i want to make my case visually and verbally 
you're only the 11th class to see what i'm  

240
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:57,840
about to show this just went down a few months 
ago in plain city ohio at a mom pod dairy farm

241
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,840
there we go

242
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:39,840
all right

243
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,840
oh you're bullying all right

244
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,800
holy [ __ ] you break a tail

245
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,840
mom get your head

246
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:17,840
like this

247
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:41,280
turn your head turn your head [ __ ]

248
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,840
turn your ass turn your ass come on

249
00:31:52,800 --> 00:32:13,840
[ __ ] tears oh i got a bad 
i have my blood pressure

250
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:27,840
i don't think they're feeling any pain i just 
keep going until the cows are oh i'm like yeah

251
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
this is not an isolated incident

252
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,560
don't for one minute think that this is an 
isolated incident this is how slaves are treated  

253
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,880
you don't really think that 
slaves get treated nicely do you  

254
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,960
you really think white people were nice when 
they ship black people over here on ships  

255
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,400
you don't think nazis were nice when they walk 
jews and gypsies into the gas chambers do you  

256
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,680
and this happens because you want to buy 
those products yeah that guy's a scumbag  

257
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,520
for doing that but he's doing that because 
you want to eat what comes out of her body  

258
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:20,320
and enough already you're not a caveman and 
you're not a cave woman anymore stop acting  

259
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:29,200
like neanderthals this is 2010 give 
it up it's not cute and it's not funny  

260
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:38,320
because animals are being abused it is not your 
right it is not your freedom to do this to them  

261
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,960
you don't get to have freedom when 
somebody else doesn't that's a violation  

262
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,680
and if you wonder why vegans get so upset 
sometimes like i am right now you just  

263
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,400
saw some of it every time we show up at a farm 
somebody's punching chicken and stabbing somebody  

264
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,560
and something else that i'm curious about how 
come when i show videos like this of people  

265
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,600
punching and kicking animals people are 
more upset with that than when they shove  

266
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,440
a knife in their throat so even if you find 
a farm where they're not punching and kicking  

267
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,959
when they shove a knife in their throat to put a 
bullet between their eyes how is that not cruelty  

268
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,920
did you know that 90 percent of hamburger 
meat in america comes from the dairy industry  

269
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,359
when cows no longer give huge amounts of milk 
after three to seven years slaughterhouse no  

270
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:43,760
exceptions if ever given a chance cows can live to 
be 18 to 25 and cows are like all female mammals  

271
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,760
i am not trying to talk down to you when i speak 
about animal issues it's just that people don't  

272
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,600
think that animals go through the same things 
the same emotions that you go through that we  

273
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:02,720
all go through in order for a female mammal 
to give to give milk she has to be pregnant  

274
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:11,600
every year every cow and every dairy farm is 
raped a long steel device shoving their vaginas  

275
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,120
to inject them with bull semen or sometimes 
they use a bare hand this forces the milk flow  

276
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,760
and after she gives birth babies are stolen and 
let me tell you something the worst scream i have  

277
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,640
ever heard and i've heard them all firsthand 
when i started finding out about this stuff  

278
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,680
a little over 15 years ago i was like everybody 
else i didn't believe it was that bad i thought  

279
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,520
everybody was exaggerating but unlike everybody 
else who just blows it aside brushes it off  

280
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,200
i actually went to see what was going on i 
spent six weeks at thorne apple valley page  

281
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,400
slaughterhouse in detroit in 1993. i broke into 
animal research laboratories i broke into fur  

282
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,280
farms i went behind the scenes of every circus 
and every rodeo that ever came through michigan  

283
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,720
worst scream i've ever heard 
a mother cow on a dairy farm  

284
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:12,160
as she screams and bellows her lungs out day after 
day for her stolen baby to be given back to her  

285
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,080
and i can only imagine the same scream every woman 
in this room would make if somebody held you down  

286
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:23,760
after birth and stole your newborn baby from you 
and why did they take babies away from their mom  

287
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,040
well the dairy is you can't have little babies 
sucking up all that milk that was meant for them  

288
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,880
when they'd rather sell it to you instead 
every time you have a glass of cow milk  

289
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,480
some calf is not and mother cows make milk 
for one reason anyways during q a we're about  

290
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,680
to have you can ask me whatever you want i'm no 
politician bring up anything if you went online  

291
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,560
before i got here saw my radical essays that 
got me kicked out of countries bring them up  

292
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,080
there is one question i will not entertain them 
you cannot ask me why cows make milk thus if  

293
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,920
it's good for us shouldn't we be feeding it 
to our kids gary shouldn't we be having it  

294
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,720
nature took care of this one at the beginning of 
time cows make milk for their babies and for their  

295
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,840
babies alone case is closed forever permanently 
no debate no discussion they don't make milk for  

296
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:25,280
baby elephants baby orangutans baby headshots 
baby rabbits baby rats baby humans adolescent  

297
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,000
humans or adult humans this body of ours has 
absolutely no need for cow milk like it has  

298
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,800
absolutely no need for giraffe milk and zebra milk 
and rhinoceros milk hippopotamus milk camel milk  

299
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,280
deer milk antelope milk horse milk pig milk dog 
milk or cat milk the only milk that we ever need  

300
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,760
is our own mother's breast milk when we're born 
that's it and when we're done weaning we never  

301
00:37:51,760 --> 00:38:00,240
need one drop of milk ever again no species on 
this planet needs milk after they're done weaning  

302
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,320
but if you want to include some kind of milk in 
your diet like i do let me reiterate the good news  

303
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,640
soy milk rice milk almond milk hemp 
milk coconut milk oat milk hazelnut milk  

304
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,160
you don't give up anything you 
got the vegan version of stuff  

305
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,720
or eat things that are truly natural like fruits 
and vegetables beans and lentils and seeds

306
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,880
so the new number one excuse to eat animals is 
no longer god says it's okay that's number two  

307
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,760
now it's now the circle of life so we're gonna 
look at the circle of life from the victim's  

308
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,920
point of view which nobody ever does as 
you're about to see this zebra does not  

309
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,120
want to be a victim to a lion any more than 
a cow or a chicken wants to be your victim

310
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,280
about to see an alligator trying 
to take down a baby impala  

311
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,400
and there's an angry vegan looking on i 
empathize he's going to get involved and stop him

312
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,800
he's about to give mouth to 
mouth and he never took the  

313
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,720
saturday morning cpr class at the local 
community college to figure out how to do that  

314
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,160
they're much brighter than we give him credit for 
but for the record not all animals are brilliant  

315
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,520
some are stupid just like human beings some 
are bright some are stupid they're just like us

316
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,640
if a bunch of violent thugs kidnapped your baby  

317
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,360
threaten and kill him and 
you are out muscled and man

318
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,240
you might go get some backup too

319
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,840
by the way the only bright 
lion in this whole pride  

320
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,840
ain't no fun when the rabbits got a gun and they 
saved their baby how about that he was still alive

321
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,320
looks like the buffaloes the zebra and the 
hippo didn't get that memo about the way  

322
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:28,800
meat eaters want the world to be good afternoon 
everybody my name is gary yourofsky i'm a vegan  

323
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,720
animal liberation activist been vegan more 
than 18 years which means i do not eat or wear  

324
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:46,080
anything that once had a face a mother or a bowel 
movement no meat cheese milk eggs and honey no fur  

325
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:55,120
leather wool silk or down and no animal byproducts 
whatsoever instead i've decided to eat normal food  

326
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,040
real food that wasn't tortured and killed 
and covered in blood and guts and pests like  

327
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,520
fruits and vegetables nuts and seeds grains 
and lentils i wear clothing made of hemp  

328
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:17,120
bamboo cotton and a host of other materials 
that were not ripped off of somebody else's body  

329
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:25,120
now i chose this lifestyle back in 1996. 
when i finally understood that speciesism  

330
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,120
believing that the human species can do 
whatever it wants to any animal species  

331
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:40,320
was the essence of bigotry and hatred more victims 
are left in this path than all other forms of  

332
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:49,680
discrimination combined worldwide we are torturing 
and killing 150 billion animals every year  

333
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,920
to satisfy our meat dairy and egg addictions 
and billions more for clothing and entertainment  

334
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,680
so when you're not vegan you end up paying 
somebody to kill thousands of animals just  

335
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,320
for you throughout your lifetime that's not 
only violent commodification and selfishness  

336
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,880
it's pure hypocrisy because what if you 
were the victim remember you have to examine  

337
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,840
all issues of injustice from the victim's point 
of view and what if somebody commodified your body  

338
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,280
labeled you stupid and dirty mocked your 
entire existence and said that your life  

339
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,680
didn't matter at all i suppose you'd want 
the world to change its evil ways immediately  

340
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,400
and hope that somebody like me would stand 
up speak out and defend your right to be free  

341
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,000
don't you think the animals we torture and kill 
feel the same exact way and speaking of stupid  

342
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,320
and dirty have you been to an airport lane seen 
a public restroom the hudson river following the  

343
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:09,440
rise of stds ever notice that the majority of 
people have never once started out on the right  

344
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:19,120
side of justice and we have the audacity to say 
that animals are stupid and dirty so how come  

345
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,960
small groups of people always have to convince 
the masses why it's wrong to enslave discriminate  

346
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:34,160
or kill innocent beings the answer 
is quite simple technologically  

347
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:45,120
we are brilliant ethically we're on par with 
parasites we are a sick twisted mistake of  

348
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,520
a species so the way we treat the animals and 
each other doesn't even shock me anymore what's  

349
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:58,080
shocking is that the masses are always shocked 
when they're accused of acting inappropriately  

350
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:06,080
it took 400 years to convince white people in 
america not to own black people and another  

351
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:12,160
100 years on top of that to end segregation and 
if somebody wants to hang out after class and  

352
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,120
explain to me why those abolitions didn't 
take two seconds i'd love to hear about it  

353
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,280
any injustice on that scale can only happen 
if the general population supports it or  

354
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:35,760
turns a blind eye to it so the key players 
in the exploitation government religion  

355
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:43,520
media corporations they become experts at lying 
and using propaganda and deceit to trick people  

356
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:52,320
into accepting the abuse the dairy industry for 
example loves to tell you about happy cows but  

357
00:44:52,320 --> 00:45:00,320
what they don't tell you is that all these happy 
cows get raped every year artificially impregnated  

358
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:07,040
with a bare hand or a long steel device to eject 
them with bold sperm female mammals have to be  

359
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:14,080
pregnant to produce and give milf mother cows then 
have their babies stolen from them after birth  

360
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,680
because once we eliminate the babies from the 
equation we get to drink all that milk instead  

361
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,800
and when mother cows can't produce huge amounts 
of milk after three to seven years they get a  

362
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:33,200
happy day at the slaughterhouse where if they're 
really lucky they'll get turned into a happy meal  

363
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,400
other companies love to lie about 
happy animals too what about that  

364
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,840
wish i wear an oscar meyer wiener jingle  

365
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,640
that's pretty cute except for the fact that when 
they're born male babies have their testicles  

366
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:56,560
ripped out without anesthetic standard practice 
the meat industry always controls procreation all  

367
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,640
the female pigs get raped every year to impregnate 
them just like the cows baby pigs then have most  

368
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,280
of their teeth cut off right down the gum line 
and their tails cut off too all without anesthetic  

369
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,880
to try and reduce flesh damage from fighting and 
biting each other in their overcrowding conditions  

370
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,240
and when pigs reach 300 pounds in six 
months thanks to genetic modification  

371
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,640
they get a happy day at the slaughterhouse too 
where they get chopped up into a thousand pieces  

372
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,600
the egg industry though man they just might 
possess the greatest marketing propaganda of  

373
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:42,480
all time because they've actually convinced 
you to eat something that came out of a hens  

374
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:50,640
all inclusive all in one ass vagina and 
the backside of a bird is called a cloaca  

375
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,960
it is one hole where the poop the p the vaginal 
fluid and scrambled eggs and omelets come from  

376
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,720
hate to be the bearer of more bad news 
but mommy and daddy lied to us too  

377
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:14,720
we're not that special and we're not perfect just 
the way we are but at least when you become vegan  

378
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:21,440
you are trying trying to reduce and eliminate 
gratuitous amounts of cruelty and violence  

379
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:30,720
which is all i'm asking of you today so how 
come when one human dies it's a tragedy but when  

380
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:38,000
billions of animals are killed with premeditation 
it's a celebration and what's really odd about  

381
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,080
this tragedy celebration dichotomy is that 
besides some kind of a self-defense situation  

382
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:51,840
everyone knows that killing is evil and 
wrong because every time a bear kills a hiker  

383
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:59,360
what do we do start saving hakuna matata praise 
the hiker for being part of the circle of life  

384
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:11,040
tell his family well he just wasn't fit enough to 
survive [ __ ] we scream bloody murder label that  

385
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,920
bear a homicidal maniac and get a bunch of people 
with guns and go kill that bear for killing the  

386
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:23,360
hiker funny how the circle of life never comes 
into play when we're getting killed and that's  

387
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:31,120
because the circle of life ain't nothing but an 
aggrandized arbitrary [ __ ] excuse to torment  

388
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:38,640
and kill somebody else with impunity it's a cute 
story it really is written directed and produced  

389
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:50,400
by us the killers the dictators the victimizers 
the victims in this psychotic scenario are not  

390
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:57,360
willing participants as you clearly saw on 
that opening video but here's something even  

391
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:03,280
more interesting than that sometimes even 
the killers question their own behavior  

392
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,760
kindness is a choice so is violence spare 
me the animals can't think or rationalize  

393
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:16,160
because they operate on instinct only nonsense 
because if you go to my website at dap.org check  

394
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:22,960
out the animal intelligence essay and click 
the link that says leopard saves a baby baboon  

395
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,840
and watch a big carnivorous cat have 
second thoughts about the circle of life  

396
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:36,080
she kills a baboon but doesn't realize the 
baboon is a mother with a newborn baby so she  

397
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:42,880
intentionally lets a skulking hyena have the dead 
mother's corpse to chomp on while she gently picks  

398
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,320
up the baby puts the baby in a tree and stays 
in the tree to protect the baby from the hyena  

399
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,960
if the circle of life was genuine and 
animals couldn't think that leopard would  

400
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:03,520
have instinctively instantly killed that baby 
instead she chose to comfort him to protect him  

401
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,480
just like most of you would do because once again 
anyone can choose to be peaceful or violent either  

402
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:19,040
way it is a choice and i have many other videos in 
that section also showing carnivores refusing to  

403
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:25,600
kill their supposed prey and for the people out 
there right now who might be thinking yeah gary  

404
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,680
but if animals want to be treated equally to us 
and treated fairly then the animals who eat other  

405
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,760
animals need to be arrested and charged with 
murder you are missing my point completely but  

406
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,600
i support that honestly i do as long as all 
the humans who eat animals turn themselves  

407
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:51,520
in to face the same consequences be careful 
about throwing stones in your glass house  

408
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,240
because if we really want to arrest animals 
and charge them with crimes they actually need  

409
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,240
equal rights they currently have no standing in 
court meaning we can't even bring them to trial  

410
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:09,040
but as soon as animals receive the same rights of 
life and liberty as us meaning they can no longer  

411
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:15,120
be the victims of slavery and murder i'll call the 
cops and the next cat i see for killing a squirrel  

412
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,800
until then i am placing the moral mirror in 
front of your faces it's time for you to walk  

413
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,440
the compassion and talk that you're always 
talking about you can't just pray for peace  

414
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,600
sing songs about love and happiness and 
togetherness turn on the five o'clock  

415
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:40,720
news hear about a tragedy and go oh that's so sad 
and then go out and do violent things like those  

416
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:47,600
damn hippies did in woodstock bunch of hippie 
crits did you know that they consumed over one  

417
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,520
million hot dogs during that four-day festival 
and i bet you thought the hippies were on my  

418
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:01,120
side peace and love and flower power my ass peace 
begins at the dinner table with a vegan meal but  

419
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:05,920
instead we always want to get together and see how 
many dead animals and nasty animal products we can  

420
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,040
eat at once bacon and eggs and cheese and steak 
and chicken and cheese and lobster six cheese  

421
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:16,400
pizzas with every pig product imaginable triple 
cheese bacon burgers with a side of asparagus  

422
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,720
wrapped in bacon we actually praise people 
in our society for killing animals you've  

423
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,720
seen all the tv shows glorifying fish killers 
duck killers chefs who cook nothing but meat  

424
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:36,160
guys who'll eat anything from testicles to brains 
schmucks who win hot dog eating contests it's now  

425
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:41,040
time to watch a five and a half minute video 
about where breakfast lunch and dinner come from  

426
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,320
and before i press play i need to 
be pretty clear about something  

427
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:53,600
there is no such thing as humane slaughter or 
humane slavery meaning that humane meat cheese  

428
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:59,840
milk eggs and honey do not exist if i told 
you that there was a nice outfit in thailand  

429
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,360
where they humanely raped kids for the child porn 
industry you know they use condoms and lubricants  

430
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:15,680
that are playing a big backyard every day 
for six glorious hours in between the rapes  

431
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:25,200
would you support it i didn't think so is that 
because rape is always evil no matter how it's  

432
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:34,640
being done so stop focusing on how animals are 
being harmed and violated and start opposing  

433
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:41,120
all the different ways of enslaving abusing 
and killing innocent beings this means that  

434
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:48,800
buying local organic cage-free free-range 
grass-fed kosher all antibiotic-free hormone-free  

435
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:57,200
is just as evil and no different than buying 
conventional from afar from a factory farm  

436
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,120
and if you feel the need to turn away or close 
your eyes during this video you might want to  

437
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:09,840
ask yourself a question if it's not good enough 
for my eyes then why is it good enough for my

438
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:23,840
stomach

439
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,840
foreign

440
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:51,840
um

441
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,840
hello

442
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:33,840
oh

443
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,840
hey

444
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:43,840
um

445
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:11,840
so

446
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,840
john never down

447
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,240
there was nothing wrong with killing 
animals and eating meat was okay  

448
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,080
how come mcdonald's and burger king and 
wendy's never show those images in their tv ads

449
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,760
are we showing you a happy singing 
smiling cartoon caricature instead

450
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,200
people are up in arms right now about all the 
beheadings taking place in the middle east

451
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,160
meanwhile 30 million innocent animals 
every day in america are beheaded  

452
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,440
and no one says a damn thing about it  

453
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,840
so i'm a little confused is beheading evil or 
does it matter who's getting their heads cut off

454
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,480
i will forever be embarrassed to be a human being  

455
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,480
to stand upright like that's something 
to be proud of you got to be kidding me  

456
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:57,440
a retired marine in north carolina once 
heard me lecture at east carolina university  

457
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:03,680
and he said gary i believe everything 
you said got no arguments for you at all  

458
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,960
but we're a bunch of violent 
monkeys what makes you think we care

459
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:18,880
to this day that statement still breaks 
my heart but i refuse to believe that  

460
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:25,600
no one cares because the only problem 
is you've been programmed not to care  

461
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:33,920
brainwashed to be a good little lifelong consumer 
of animal body parts same thing happened to me for  

462
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:43,840
the first part of my life for 25 years but if you 
just put your defenses down i can un-brainwash and  

463
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:49,840
deprogram you for free no gimmicks no books 
to buy no email list to join i just want to  

464
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:55,840
put you back in touch with your conscience again 
the conscience that you had when you were young  

465
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:05,200
innocent and uncorrupted by society's lies it 
can't be that difficult to understand that each  

466
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:11,840
animal values his or her life as much as you 
value yours you might not care about cows and  

467
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,160
pigs and chickens and fish but when your thoughts 
are prejudicial who the hell cares what you think  

468
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:27,280
believe whatever you want to believe but you 
have no right to act out your violent desires and  

469
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,440
listen if you want to sit around all day smoking 
weed eating oreo cookies sipping on a two liter  

470
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:41,600
of mountain dew be my guest because ain't nothing 
wrong with smoking some kush and oreos and soda  

471
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:47,520
happen to be vegan they're sugar and chemicals 
pure garbage but if you want to harm yourself  

472
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:54,240
you have every right to do so i am not the health 
police but you have no right to harm somebody else  

473
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:01,440
in the process of harming yourself so i am the 
ethics police and vegans will defend animals from  

474
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,360
you until this massacre stops you don't really 
think the entire animal kingdom worships us  

475
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:16,160
thinks we're special believes that we are the 
image of god we're like a colombian drug cartel  

476
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:23,280
we're a bunch of bullies criminals and killers 
a symbiotic relationship between humans and  

477
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,320
animals is not happening when all we do is 
take and take and take and take a little more  

478
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:37,840
we steal their milk their eggs their honey 
their skin their flesh their lives symbiotic  

479
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,680
relationships are supposed to benefit each 
party when there's only one beneficiary  

480
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:50,560
it's called slavery it's time to become the 
rational beings that we always claim to be  

481
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:57,040
and speaking of becoming rational got to say 
something to my religious friends out there today  

482
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:05,440
because the oldest excuse in the book god says 
it's okay is the dumbest [ __ ] i've ever heard  

483
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:13,040
in my life to harm somebody else because if you 
believe that god gave us the architectural plans  

484
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,960
to construct a house of slaughter so we can 
cut the heads off of his terrified animals  

485
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,560
that he doesn't mind when we steal newborn 
babies from their mothers or cut their horns  

486
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:30,720
and beaks and tails and teeth off while they're 
fully conscious then what does the devil do

487
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,840
what could a cow a pig a chicken or turkey ever do  

488
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:43,840
to deserve the wrath of god 
himself or eternal damnation

489
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,760
and for the atheists and the agnostics in the 
crowd you ain't off the hook either where's that  

490
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,440
logical lifestyle you're always preaching about 
because if you discriminate against animals and  

491
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,960
eat meat cheese milk eggs and honey then you are 
no different than all the religious people that  

492
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:14,160
you condemn and for the record i do not condemn 
god i condemn violent rituals and bloodthirsty  

493
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,080
habits and traditions in god's name because i've 
noticed something quite disturbing about all  

494
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:27,760
religious people all over this planet they never 
ever worship anything that god actually created  

495
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:38,000
the only worship things that we created in god's 
name bibles crosses churches synagogues korans  

496
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,400
stars of david the wailing wall i 
can assure you that god is completely  

497
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:49,680
unimpressed with our creations and with us as long 
as we act like barbarians living in peace though  

498
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,720
i think you'd be pretty impressed with that you 
can't possibly believe there are slaughter houses  

499
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:03,120
in heaven or that violence against animals was 
allowed in the garden of eden and those are god's  

500
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:09,120
two most perfect places now i want to destroy 
some other lies you've heard way too much about  

501
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:15,520
first people often ask me why we can't eat eggs 
from some hens living in our backyard or from a  

502
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:24,560
free range farm their bodies do not belong to us 
commodification is the crime as much as cruelty is  

503
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,960
and i've noticed that nobody ever wants to adopt 
old hens to live in their backyard the ones who  

504
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,240
have stopped laying eggs they only want the 
young ones who are still freshly modified  

505
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:45,200
genetically to lay 300 eggs every year 
instead of their normal 17 eggs every year  

506
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:50,080
pens just like sheep in the 
wool industry always get killed  

507
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:56,960
when they stop producing things that we want them 
to produce and finally let's talk about the plants  

508
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:04,080
and whether they suffer because the latest idiocy 
and lunacy being tossed my way the last couple  

509
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:09,280
of years has been hey man carrots suffer and 
die just like cows do so what's the difference

510
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,640
okay in case you were unaware of this difference 
you have to have a functioning central nervous  

511
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:23,360
system connected to a brain in order to suffer and 
this is not up for debate which is why people in  

512
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:32,720
the hospital who are brain dead but still alive 
but can't feel anything are cold how about that  

513
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:40,080
little truth in science for a change yeah we don't 
call these people fish we don't call them chickens  

514
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:47,120
and turkeys and cows and pigs we call them 
vegetables but even if someone somehow proved  

515
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:53,680
that in sentient life forms like plants were 
capable of suffering we're causing more harm  

516
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,680
to the planet by harvesting all the plants 
and feeding all those plants to the animals  

517
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,720
and killing all the animals to get 
the nutrients they got from the plants  

518
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:07,120
which were all the nutrients that we needed to 
begin with with all the crop land in america alone  

519
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:14,880
america could be feeding 10 billion people again 
there's only and a half billion on the planet  

520
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:20,480
which means less land would be used less plants 
would be harvested less violence committed  

521
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:27,040
if we ate plants directly and if plants really 
can't suffer how can firefighters never rescue  

522
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:33,120
them and don't say it's discriminatory 
because animals are the most discriminated  

523
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:38,080
species on this planet but there's still a 
plan in place to save them during a fight  

524
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:44,320
humans get safe first but if it's safe to do 
so even if it's unsafe to do so they'll go  

525
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:51,920
back inside and save the animals but even if it 
were safe to do so again no fire fighter in the  

526
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,280
history of the world has ever gone back in a 
third time to save the chrysanthemums hey bob  

527
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,320
quick you saved the basil plant from the kitchen 
i'll get the road identity from the second floor  

528
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:09,840
do you think that if i gain lectures about cruelty 
to vegetables especially root vegetables like yams  

529
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,320
called my speech the silence of the yams

530
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,880
because everybody knows that yams scream 
for about 30 to 45 seconds after you gank  

531
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:26,800
them out of the ground before they die that 
i would have been invited into 180 schools  

532
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:35,840
to give 2600 lectures to 60 000 students in 30 
different states and i was just thinking about  

533
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:41,680
this the other day but what do we say about fruits 
and vegetables when they get old they're ripe  

534
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:53,760
ready to eat or rot and what do we say 
about animals when they get old they're old  

535
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,720
because animals are alive in 
the exact same way that we are  

536
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:12,640
and plants are food so can we please stop making 
up idiotic excuses to torture and kill the animals  

537
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,840
and make up an excuse to care about them instead 
to become vegan actually live by the golden rule  

538
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:26,960
instead of just paying lip service to it do 
unto others as you would have others do unto you

539
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:36,720
good evening my name is gary yourofsky in 1996 
i founded adapt which became michigan's most  

540
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:42,960
outspoken and radical animal rights organization 
in 2002 i became the official orator of peta  

541
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:48,640
people for the ethical treatment of animals 
because of my michigan ties many midwestern  

542
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,840
law enforcement agencies government officials 
media people and politicians know me as the  

543
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:59,680
most outspoken and radical activist not only in 
the state of michigan but in the entire midwest  

544
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:08,880
i have been arrested 13 times for random acts of 
kindness and compassion following in the footsteps  

545
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:14,400
of other routine radical law breakers like dr 
martin luther king jr mohandas gandhi nelson  

546
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:22,160
mandela and jesus please do not misconstrue what i 
am saying i do not think i am king nor gandhi nor  

547
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:30,240
mandela nor jesus but i am following in their 
routine radical law-breaking footsteps in 1997  

548
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:39,520
i liberated 1542 mink from an animal concentration 
camp in canada euphemistically referred to as a  

549
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:46,240
fur farm subsequently i received a six-month 
sentence in maximum security where i spent 77  

550
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:55,040
days there before being deported back to michigan 
once a liberator and now an educator before i talk  

551
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:00,560
about the vegan ethic i need to let everyone know 
that i did not come here today to be your enemy i

came here to educate and enlighten tell you things 
you're not supposed to be told and show you things  

553
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:11,680
you are never supposed to see if you want to make 
me your enemy today hey that's fine join the club  

554
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:16,480
i have thousands of enemies nationwide heck i 
can even put you in contact with some of them  

555
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:22,800
if you'd like today's speech is intended to 
uplift you morally now before we continue i  

556
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:28,160
need to show you seven minutes of graphic video

death trade in the name of vanity and greed every

year 40 million animals have the fur ripped off 
their bodies in a disgusting display of inhumanity

manual neck breakings mass gassings and anal 
and genital electrocutions are the standard  

572
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:06,240
killing techniques used on every animal murdered

violent annual carnage while the vicious steel 
jaw leg hole trap kills millions of free roaming

research experiments outrageous lies from the  

579
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,880

582
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:12,160
the circus meets every definition of slavery 
animals chained and caged and forced to perform  

583
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,440
unnatural tricks against their will animals 
bought rented and sold and shipped around like  

584
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:23,360
cargo in boxcars and semis while someone else 
profits off their labor and from their misery  

585
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:29,600
humanitarian dick gregory once proclaimed when 
i look at animals held captive by circuses  

586
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,680
i think of slavery animals and circuses represent 
domination and oppression they wear the same  

587
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:41,440
chains and shackles all circuses use violence 
to train elephants lions bears and tigers and  

588
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:47,520
the training sessions are comprised of beatings 
with hooks iron bars whips and sticks fear is  

589
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:53,520
the only way to make these wild animals submit and 
perform most circus animals also develop neurotic  

590
01:14:53,520 --> 01:15:00,000
behaviors elephants sway from side to side lions 
and tigers pace and bears rock back and forth  

591
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,920
in their tiny cages please extend some freedom to 
those who have none go to this website or call us

593
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,840
oh

594
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:37,840

595
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:51,840
you hear that screaming did you 
know you've got their attention

596
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:19,840
oh

597
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:47,840
oh

598
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,840
god

599
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,840
this

600
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,840
foreign

601
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:39,520
german philosopher arthur schopenhauer once said 
that all truth passes through three stages first  

602
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:46,160
it is ridiculed second it is violently opposed 
and third it is accepted as being self-evident  

603
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,240
unfortunately the hatred and i mean hatred 
that humans have towards non-human animals  

604
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:58,800
is so vicious vile and powerful animal rights 
has not yet reached schopenhauer's third stage  

605
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:05,120
of common sense the human intellect remains 
so remedial and self-absorbed the notion of  

606
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:11,760
animal rights is usually mocked or ignored but i 
think it's high time that humans climb down off  

607
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:18,320
their make-believe pyramids of domination 
and extend some simple decency some simple  

608
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:25,520
decency to our planetary companions before this 
discussion continues i need to let everyone know  

609
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:32,640
that i am not an animal lover do not refer to me 
as an animal lover this might shock you but i do  

610
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:38,000
not love animals oh i have the utmost empathy 
for their plate but you cannot refer to me as  

611
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,200
an animal lover i fight for animal liberation and 
peace because i loathe injustice and despise the  

612
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:49,440
way humans mistreat the animal kingdom i spend 
less than one percent of my time watching animal  

613
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:55,200
planet national geographic or discovery 
channel sharing the mating habits of the  

614
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:04,640
blue-footed boobie does not make the world a nice 
eclipse only veganism can do that which is why i  

615
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:11,920
am vegan vegan means i do not eat anything 
that had a face a mother or a bowel movement  

616
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:19,520
vegan also means i do not consume any product 
that was derived from anything that had a face  

617
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:26,160
a mother or a bowel movement if you're still 
consuming food that once went to the bathroom  

618
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:33,040
that once defecated and urinated you might want 
to change your diet repeat its veggie starter kit  

619
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:39,600
and go vegan vegan also means i do not wear any 
animal skins obviously fur but that includes  

620
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:48,720
leather wool silk and down payless 15.99 fake 
leather let me mention this about leather you  

621
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:54,080
know most people find it morally reprehensible 
for people to wear fur yet those same people  

622
01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:00,000
don't find it morally reprehensible for people 
to wear leather but besides size shape and color  

623
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,560
there is no inherent difference between 
a cow and a mink or a cow in a fox  

624
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:10,480
cow skin is mink skin is fox skin cows feel 
the same amount of pain is making foxes  

625
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:17,120
and a cow wants to keep her skin attached to her 
body as much as a fox wants to keep hers so you  

626
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:23,840
must condemn both fur and leather condemning 
one and not the other would be hypocritical  

627
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:32,240
of all the exploited beings on the face of the 
earth animals are the most violated that's why  

628
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:37,840
i'm here today to ask you to join millions of 
others in a remarkable crusade against oppression  

629
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:43,520
but before anyone decides to engage in this 
compassionate crusade understand there is one  

630
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:49,280
important stipulation that you must adhere to all 
of your prejudices must be extinguished there is  

631
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:56,240
no room for any racism sexism heterosexism or 
of course speciesism which might be a new word  

632
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:02,720
to most people today speciesism the unfounded 
unethical and unprincipled view that the human  

633
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:08,160
animal has every right to mistreat exploit and 
murder the non-human animal and just like the  

634
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:14,880
previous isms speciesism lacks coherent thought 
and is a narrow-minded view of the life that  

635
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:22,560
comprises this planet nobel prize winner isaac 
basha this singer who escaped nazi-occupied poland  

636
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:29,280
and lost family members in concentration camps 
once called speciesism the purest form of racism  

637
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:38,160
2600 years ago the great philosopher pythagoras 
said this about speciesism as long as humans  

638
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:44,160
continue to be the ruthless destroyer of other 
beings we will never know health or peace for  

639
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:50,320
as long as people massacre animals they will kill 
each other indeed those who sow the seed of murder  

640
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:58,880
and pain will ever reap joy or love after studying 
those statements and others i now understand  

641
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:04,160
that speciesism is the root of all hatred of all 
violence of all discrimination that exists on this  

642
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:09,520
planet and we will never destroy the branches 
of hatred like racism sexism and heterosexism  

643
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,080
unless we destroy violence and hatred and 
bloodthirstiness at its root and that root  

644
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:19,360
is speciesism the first form of hatred that human 
beings are taught is to eat the animal translation  

645
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:24,800
mistreat the animal translation hate the animal 
translation view the animal as an inanimate object  

646
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:30,960
and a mere commodity before anyone is ever taught 
to hate or discriminate against a gay person they  

647
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,040
are taught to hate and discriminate against 
animals for anyone has ever taught to hate or  

648
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,440
discriminate against a certain race or ethnicity 
they are taught to hate and discriminate against  

649
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:45,920
animals before any man was ever taught to mistreat 
a woman he is taught to mistreat an animal  

650
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:51,760
did you know that each person 
who chooses to eat animal flesh  

651
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,840
is responsible for the murder of 3 000 
land animals throughout their lifetime  

652
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:06,080
whether you kill thousands in 78 years or 78 
minutes you are still a killer and a terrorist  

653
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,920
i did not come here today to try and convince you 
that animals are more important than human beings  

654
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,480
because the issue of importance is 
irrelevant to how animals should be treated  

655
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,320
no one in this movement has ever said that a 
mouse is more important than your mother your  

656
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:27,120
father your sister or your brother because we 
don't make an arbitrary list of who's important  

657
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:33,280
and we don't care about anyone else's arbitrary 
list of who's more important we care about peace  

658
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:44,960
justice the mahatma mohandas gandhi once said this 
i do not regard flesh food as necessary to us i  

659
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:50,880
hold fresh food to be unsuited to our species the 
life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a  

660
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:57,360
human being i should be unwilling to take the life 
of a lamb for the sake of the human body the more  

661
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:03,280
helpless the creature is the more it is entitled 
to protection from humans from the cruelty of  

662
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:09,440
humans gandhi was just one of many luminaries 
throughout history who adopted the animal rights  

663
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:15,840
lifestyle he was a true humanitarian who opened 
up his circle of compassion to include animals not  

664
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:21,360
exclude them other people throughout history who 
adopted the animal rights lifestyle and practice  

665
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:27,600
vegetarianism and veganism pythagoras plato 
socrates einstein george bernard shaw schweitzer  

666
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:34,160
harry feature stone percy shelley tolstoy 
da vinci and cesar chavez just to name a few  

667
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,320
around six years ago when i fully embraced 
the peaceful philosophy of animal rights  

668
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,600
and understood that animals had an inherent right 
to be free and live completely unfettered by human  

669
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:51,440
dominance i wondered why it took me more than 
20 years to attain this non-violent awakening  

670
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,480
i asked myself who taught me that animals were put 
on this earth for food who taught me to disrespect  

671
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:01,680
animals and view them as mere commodities who 
stole my compassion my empathy and my conscience  

672
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:06,640
who lied to me who instilled that vicious 
mindset of human to animal exploitation  

673
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:13,360
as standard operating procedure each and every 
person in this room should ask those same  

674
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:18,960
questions think deeply about that who taught that 
violence to you who told you that animals should  

675
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,840
be your food your clothing your entertainment and 
your research specimens who lied to you who took  

676
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:29,280
your compassion your empathy and your conscience 
who gave you the belief system that embraces the  

677
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:38,000
misery and murder of innocent animals was it your 
parents your friends your institutions of learning  

678
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:46,320
your government your religion i'm sure you'll 
find just like i did that it was one or more of  

679
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:52,640
those aforementioned entities who taught you and 
me to believe endless lies for they too have been  

680
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:59,040
lied to or they will benefit from those lies i'm 
asking everyone to reevaluate your belief system  

681
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,880
ask yourself why is this violence 
being permitted for what reasons  

682
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,880
and i hope you'll have the same revelation 
that i did the non-violence through veganism  

683
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,880
non-violence through animal liberation is the only 
ethical and acceptable way to live on this planet  

684
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:25,360
let's begin a formal discussion on veganism and 
don't forget after the talk check out govege.com  

685
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:32,560
last year in the u.s alone 10 billion cows 
pigs chickens turkeys and other animals  

686
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:39,280
were raised in concentration camps euphemistically 
referred to as factory farms they were sent to  

687
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:43,840
slaughterhouses where knife-wielding carnivores 
hang them upside down slit their throats drain  

688
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:49,680
their blood and dismember their bodies then 
because most people have acquired a taste for  

689
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:56,880
animal flesh i stress acquired taste for animal 
flesh their dismembered bodies were cooked  

690
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:02,160
and eaten did you know that sows 
female pigs are forced to live  

691
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,560
their entire lives and give birth in 
gestation crates and farrowing stalls  

692
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:13,200
these prisons are so tiny a simple task like 
turning around is a fantasy to a female pig now  

693
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:18,880
this intense confinement slowly drives her insane 
and she ends up exhibiting neuronic behaviors like  

694
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,840
bar biting where she bites the metal bars that 
can find her all day long she bites these bars  

695
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:30,080
in the slightly larger areas where the male pigs 
the hogs are kept other neuronic behaviors occur  

696
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:36,720
fighting is common because of overcrowding and 
when pigs fight they've been known to attack  

697
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:42,080
each other's tails so how does the pig industry 
solve the fighting problem two ways one ignore  

698
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:49,440
the situation two vicious intervention first pigs 
have their tails chopped off without anesthetic  

699
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:56,320
then in a depraved attempt to reduce the 
effects of industry induced aggression pigs  

700
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:02,960
have up to eight teeth chopped off down to the 
gum line with a pair of wire cutter-like devices  

701
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:09,600
and finally to top off the barbarity their 
testicles are ripped out as well oh in order  

702
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:14,080
to mark them to keep track of them they have 
holes punched in their ears it's called ear notch  

703
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,960
can you imagine being hated so vehemently 
that someone would rip out portions of your  

704
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:26,400
ear or castrate you or cut your teeth off 
down to the gum line all without anesthetic

705
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:34,480
did you know that the animal welfare act of the 
1960s which happens to be a pathetic piece of  

706
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:39,760
legislation kind of like our constitution when it 
was first created which left out many more humans  

707
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:45,120
than it ever led in originally the animal welfare 
act unequivocally allows people to torture  

708
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:51,600
enslave terrorize and murder all animals even 
endangered ones if you apply for the proper permit  

709
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:56,160
the animal welfare act is a how-to guide 
to animal exploitation torture them this  

710
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:00,000
way don't torture them that way and slave them 
like this don't enslave them like that and kill  

711
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,520
them this way don't kill them that way circuses 
slaughterhouses and research labs love to say  

712
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,640
hey gary hey peta leave us alone we're in 
complete compliance with the animal welfare act  

713
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,960
well my dear friends you'd have to be a vicious 
idiot not to be in compliance with the animal  

714
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:26,000
welfare act once again since the basis 
of the awa is torture terror and murder  

715
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:34,320
how could an animal exploiter not be in compliance 
the awa's mandate for food and water does not ease  

716
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:40,960
the terror nor stop the murder smithfield 
the number one killer of pigs in the world  

717
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:47,920
generates 8 billion dollars every year by 
killing eleven hundred pigs every hour in  

718
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:56,000
fact smithfield's five biggest concentration 
camps kills 78 000 pigs every day you know what  

719
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,720
government agencies in charge of enforcing the 
awa the u.s department of agriculture the same  

720
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:08,400
agency that oversees the murder of 10 billion 
land animals seem a little incongruous why don't  

721
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:13,760
we put pedophiles in charge of child protection 
laws misogynist in charge of domestic abuse laws  

722
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:21,120
and hunters in charge of wildlife management my 
bad we do that one already little sidebar for you  

723
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:28,000
every single state and national wildlife agency 
is run solely by hunters and hunt supporters  

724
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,480
period point blank there are no animal 
rights humanitarians on these committees  

725
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:38,320
you know how the hunting community always claims 
that killing animals is sound scientific wildlife  

726
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:43,680
management if that were the case and 
how come in every single newspaper  

727
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:50,320
in the usa hunting stories are always placed 
in the sports section not the science section

728
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,360
of the 10 billion land animals killed for food  

729
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:02,080
chickens represent 9 billion with 
another 250 million enslaved on egg farms  

730
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:07,680
now raised in huge buildings these factory farm 
warehouses enslave anywhere from 5 thousand  

731
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:13,920
to eighty thousand birds in one building eighteen 
by twenty inch battery cages for the egg length  

732
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,680
tens while the chickens the males are 
strewn about in a chaotic free-for-all  

733
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:25,680
the tiny battery cages are a staple of the egg 
industry where 5 to 11 birds share one cage but  

734
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:31,280
inside or outside of the cage these places 
of horror deny natural behaviors to chickens  

735
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:38,480
and hens like dust bathing preening and happily 
roaming freely something we all take for granted

736
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:46,640
for the record hens prefer more space than 18 
by 20 inches and chickens do not like to live  

737
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:52,000
in groups larger than 30. therefore fighting 
is common in the chicken and egg industries  

738
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,040
how do they treat the fighting problem two ways 
one ignore the situation two vicious intervention  

739
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,760
chickens and hens are de-beaked 
meaning the sensitive portion  

740
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:07,280
top two-thirds of the beak is seared off with 
a red hot blade heated to 800 degrees celsius  

741
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:15,120
egg laying hens are shot off with so many 
antibiotics they're forced to lay up to 300 eggs  

742
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:22,240
every year because of this their uteruses have 
been known to bleed and protrude from their bodies

743
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:29,680
when hens can't keep up with the demands of the 
egg industry they don't go to sanctuaries people  

744
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:36,560
they're sent to slaughterhouses and killed let's 
not forget that egg farms have to breed birds  

745
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:42,640
so there's always a fresh supply of hens to lay 
eggs but upon hatching if those babies turn out  

746
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:47,680
to be males in the egg industry they're considered 
useless to the egg industry because they don't lay  

747
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:54,240
eggs only females can do that so male babies are 
put in plastic bags suffocated tossed in the trash  

748
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:59,280
or they're thrown into huge rendering 
machines where their live bodies are ground up  

749
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:05,760
and used as feed bottom line whether it's an egg 
length and a factory farmed chicken a free-range  

750
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:12,160
chicken or an organically raised chicken they all 
end up dead from unnatural causes because people  

751
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:19,920
have acquired a taste for animal flesh comedian 
dennis miller who was not an activist one  

752
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:25,440
sarcastically yet truthfully made this statement 
about free-range chicken farms free-range chickens  

753
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:31,760
they all end up dead don't seem that free to 
me don't be duped by the free range industry  

754
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:38,720
cows turkeys ducks sheep and other animals 
are subjected to the same barbaric treatment  

755
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:45,520
bulls are castrated because cows are artificially 
inseminated in fact nearly every male animal is  

756
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:50,000
considered expendable because nowadays just 
about every animal raised and killed for food  

757
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:55,600
on this planet is artificially inseminated and 
genetically engineered in case you don't believe  

758
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:01,600
me i'm sure everybody read the latest edition of 
pork everybody got their latest edition of pork in  

759
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:08,000
the mail right right along with sports illustrated 
newsweek cosmopolitan pork big industry trade  

760
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,840
journal if you flip around the pages of pork 
you'll find an advertisement for a ginetta pork  

761
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:21,920
better pigs better pork better profits ginetta 
pork better pigs better pork better profits  

762
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:29,840
genetic one of dozens of companies now creating 
the food that you eat every woman in this room  

763
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,640
should think deeply about the frightening fact 
of animal reproduction because many feminists  

764
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:39,520
throughout history from annie besson and susan 
b anthony to alice walker and gloria steinem  

765
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:46,640
became animal rights humanitarians because these 
great women not only understood that animals had  

766
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,960
an inherent right to be free but these great 
women understood that their non-human sisters  

767
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:55,760
were being exploited for their reproductive organs 
the female animal is viewed as nothing more than  

768
01:36:55,760 --> 01:37:02,720
a baby machine by the greedy callous malefactors 
who run the animal flesh industry l.j taylor of  

769
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:08,880
walls meat limited once said this in a national 
hog farmer magazine i'm sure everybody has read  

770
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:15,760
their latest edition of national hog farm the 
breeding style should be thought of and treated  

771
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:22,320
as a valuable piece of machinery whose function 
is the pump out baby pigs the sausage machine

772
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:32,080
last year in the u.s alone 17 billion fish 
shrimp lobsters and other aquatic animals  

773
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:37,360
were killed and eaten many were raised on fish 
farms they were genetically engineered yes  

774
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,960
fish farms farming is not just 
relegated to the land anymore

775
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:50,960
l.a times one of its 2002 editions bounty 
farms one of dozens of companies now  

776
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:56,000
creating fish genetically engineering them 
if you look at the photo in the upper left  

777
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,840
you'll notice that they have genetically altered a 
salmon to be twice as big as its wild counterpart  

778
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:09,200
the rest of the aquatic animals were either 
hooked by the mouth or netted in huge trawlers  

779
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:13,520
gigantic high-powered vacuum cleaners that 
sucked up catch and kill everything in its  

780
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:20,560
path in order to explain why fishing is cruel 
vicious and unethical i decided to use an analogy  

781
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:28,640
today to help you empathize imagine reaching for 
an apple on a tree and having your hands suddenly  

782
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:34,640
impaled by a metal hook that drags you the whole 
weight of your body pulling on that one hand  

783
01:38:34,640 --> 01:38:39,280
dragging you out of the air and into an 
atmosphere in which you cannot breathe  

784
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:45,120
that is what aquatic animals experience 
they are removed from their watery habitat  

785
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:53,600
civil rights activist animal rights activist 
humanitarian alice walker once eloquently summed  

786
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:59,840
up the reason for animal freedom the animals of 
the world exist for their own reasons they were  

787
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:05,600
not made for humans any more than black people 
were made for whites or women were created for men  

788
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:12,080
go by the books diet for a new america or the food 
revolution both by john robbins for an amazing  

789
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:18,000
comprehensive look at veganism and john robbins 
happens to be quite a remarkable individual  

790
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,360
you might recognize him by his last 
name if you think about it long enough  

791
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:30,400
his family owns the billion dollar baskin robbins 
ice cream empire however about 20 years ago  

792
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:34,960
john robbins removed himself from the family 
business because he wanted no part of an  

793
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:40,160
industry that exploited and murdered cows and 
no part of an industry that made people ill  

794
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:45,680
by feeding them animal secretions cow's milk 
is a secretion and secretions are filled with  

795
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:51,600
delicious fluids like pus and mucus i hope you 
realize that when a dairy cow can no longer give  

796
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:57,920
quality milk or produce huge amounts of milk she's 
sent to the slaughterhouse and killed there are  

797
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:04,400
no cow sanctuaries in the dairy industry in fact 
when it comes to pain and suffering the dairy cow  

798
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:09,600
just might suffer more than any enslaved animal 
on this planet chino california for instance  

799
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:17,200
they had the largest concentration of dairy farms 
on this planet more than 350 000 cows lived there  

800
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,920
kept alive for three to seven years machines 
hooked up to their udders for several hours  

801
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:27,280
a day sucking milk out with hormones and 
antibiotics forced into their bodies to make  

802
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:33,040
them produce tremendous amounts of milk until they 
can no longer produce tremendous amounts of milk  

803
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:39,920
you know the dairy industry has done a masterful 
job at convincing everyone that cows naturally  

804
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:46,240
give milk i hope you don't believe that cows 
are like any other female animal they can only  

805
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:53,040
give milk during and after pregnancy so once a 
year dairy cows are artificially impregnated to  

806
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:58,800
keep the milk flow going and within two days of 
giving birth within two days their babies are  

807
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:04,160
taken away from them which is outright cruelty in 
and of itself their babies are stolen from them  

808
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:10,560
at birth most of the male babies sent off the 
veal farms putting crates so tiny they're never  

809
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:15,360
allowed to stand up ropes and chains put around 
their necks to completely immobilize them and  

810
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:22,400
prevent any muscle development whatsoever which 
is why veal flesh is tender no muscle development  

811
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:28,480
as for the females most of the females kept on 
the dairy farm enslaved like their mothers they  

812
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:34,960
will be turned into dairy cows as well the rest 
of the females and some of the males sold to the  

813
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:45,840
beef industry where they will be killed at nine 
months of age thank you very much for listening

814
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:52,720
okay i'm going to take you guys on a 
journey today and like all journeys in  

815
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:57,040
life there's going to be ups and downs highs 
and lows you're going to like certain parts  

816
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:02,560
and dislike other parts in other words you 
will love me and hate me today all at once  

817
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:08,640
but if you listen with an open mind i promise at 
the end of the speech the love will outweigh the  

818
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:15,760
hate the first 30 minutes will be very intense i'm 
going to make you feel angry frustrated and guilty  

819
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:20,880
fortunately the last 15 minutes will be like 
a comedy roast so we're gonna laugh and giggle  

820
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:25,520
you guys are getting roasted by the way so i'm 
gonna speak for around 45 minutes and then we'll  

821
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:31,840
do a q a session after so hold your questions 
until the end right now i want you to think  

822
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:38,080
about how you would feel if the moment you were 
born someone else had already planned the day  

823
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:47,360
of your execution that's what it's like to be a 
cow a pig a chicken or a turkey on this planet  

824
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:54,480
they're not born free they're born to be murdered 
even though freedom is supposed to be a birthright  

825
01:42:55,040 --> 01:43:01,600
a god-given right i mean no god would be 
a slave master a torturer and a killer  

826
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:09,840
of his animals his babies if he was then 
he wouldn't be god he'd be the devil  

827
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:17,760
if that statement shocks you or brings up feelings 
of animosity towards me the problem isn't with me  

828
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:25,440
and what i've just said the problem is that humans 
have victimized animals to such a degree that they  

829
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:32,080
aren't even considered victims they aren't even 
considered at all they're nothing they don't count  

830
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:39,440
they don't matter they're commodities like tv sets 
and cell phones we've actually turned animals into  

831
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:48,720
inanimate objects sandwiches and shoes it 
is the greatest magic trick ever performed  

832
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:56,480
the animation switch and besides the money 
made from selling their flesh and skin and  

833
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:03,360
the things that come out of their bodies there's 
not even decent value on them as inanimate objects  

834
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:12,800
the american flag for example which is nothing 
but a piece of fabric the bible which is nothing  

835
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:19,840
but a book comprised of ink and paper stir 
up more emotions than the murder of animals  

836
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:27,120
if there were a barbecue near campus today and 
people were cooking up steaks and hamburgers man  

837
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:33,920
there'd be a party people would actually celebrate 
the cow who was killed the person who killed the  

838
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:42,320
cow and the chef that seasoned her dead body but 
if someone poured gasoline on the flag or a bible  

839
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:50,560
struck a match and set it on fire lord have 
mercy there'd be an angry mob ready to kill  

840
01:44:50,560 --> 01:45:00,400
somebody these lifeless inanimate objects the flag 
in the bible are more sacred than animals living  

841
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:10,640
feeling breathing beings animals are victims the 
most oppressed ever and if you're having a tough  

842
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:16,000
time grasping this fact maybe it's because 
the only time you ever come into contact  

843
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:22,480
with cows and chickens and turkeys is when 
they're cut up and cooked on your dinner table  

844
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:35,040
so good afternoon everybody my name is gary 
yourofsky i'm a vegan animal liberation activist  

845
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:41,280
i'm not a politician and i'm not a salesperson 
that means i got no lies to tell you and no books  

846
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:49,440
and no dvds to sell you before i continue i want 
to define the word vegan for everybody v-e-g-a-n  

847
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:59,280
vegans just like vegetarians do not consume the 
meat of any land or marine animal vegans however  

848
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:08,960
unlike vegetarians also refrain from eating cheese 
milk eggs honey any animal product whatsoever  

849
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:19,120
we also don't wear animal skin no fur leather wool 
silk or down i want to let you know that i was not  

850
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:26,640
raised vegan i ate meat cheese milk and eggs 
for around 25 years and like most people  

851
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:31,440
i always thought that i cared about 
animals because i loved dogs and cats  

852
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:38,800
who were chipmunks and squirrels until one day 
after seeing some animals backstage at a circus  

853
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:44,480
chained up and caged up i not only 
realized that i was witnessing a slave show  

854
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:55,120
i realized i was a hypocrite a bigot a speciesist 
just like a racist who believes that their race is  

855
01:46:55,120 --> 01:47:02,320
more special and more important than all the other 
races a speciesist believes that humans are more  

856
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:09,280
special and more important than all the animals 
and therefore have the right to enslave and kill  

857
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:16,320
any species they choose but if you honestly 
place yourself in the animal's position  

858
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:23,920
looking at this issue from the victim's point 
of view being denied your freedom and the right  

859
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:30,320
to live a long healthy life and then imagine 
yourself confined in a concentration camp truck  

860
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:37,040
on your way to a slaughterhouse so someone could 
slice your throat and cut you up into pieces  

861
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,160
i'm pretty sure you would understand 
why the psychotic addictions of meat  

862
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:49,600
cheese milk and eggs must be abolished if you eat 
animals and the things that come out of animals  

863
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:56,400
you are intentionally causing pain and suffering 
and polluting your soul with the blood of innocent  

864
01:47:56,400 --> 01:48:05,680
beings humanity's main focus should always be 
extending compassion to others not engaging in  

865
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:13,600
rituals and traditions that are based on cruelty 
there's a massacre taking place right now it's the  

866
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:21,600
world's largest and longest-running massacre of 
all time because every second of every minute of  

867
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:29,680
every hour of every day female animals are raped 
to impregnate them so we can steal their babies  

868
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:35,840
separate families from each other so we 
can kill them and sell their flesh and skin  

869
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:43,520
if that's not the definition of injustice 
of an atrocity then i'd like to know what is  

870
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:48,960
you do realize that if you went to the 
nearest cow or chicken slaughterhouse  

871
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,960
and remove the animals and then 
replace them with human beings

872
01:48:55,280 --> 01:49:01,680
all of a sudden it's a tragedy auschwitz 
is resurrected slave ships sail again  

873
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:08,240
and don't think i'm the first person to make 
these valid comparisons civil rights activist  

874
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:14,480
dick gregory once said when i look at animals 
held captive by circuses i think of slavery  

875
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:22,720
animals and circuses represent domination and 
oppression they wear the same chains and shackles  

876
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:32,640
isaac bashevis singer who escaped nazi occupied 
poland once condemned our speciesistic world when  

877
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:40,400
he said what do they know all these scholars all 
these philosophers all the leaders of the world  

878
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:49,200
they have convinced themselves that man the worst 
transgressor of all the species is the crown of  

879
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:56,800
creation and all the animals were made for us to 
be food and pelts to be tormented and exterminated  

880
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:09,840
in relation to animals all humans are nazis 
for the animals it is an eternal treblinka  

881
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:14,720
now i know these statements sound 
pretty harsh and controversial to you  

882
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:23,280
but that doesn't mean they aren't true the fact 
that anyone would fight against veganism against  

883
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:29,600
animal liberation which means you are against 
compassion just proves how completely irrational  

884
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:38,320
meat dairy and egg eaters can be vegans 
are only asking you to change what you eat  

885
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:48,640
not who you are stay jewish christian or catholic 
stay muslim buddhist hindu atheist agnostic stay  

886
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:54,160
left or right in politics if you honestly 
place yourself in the animal's position  

887
01:50:55,040 --> 01:51:00,400
there's no way you can justify the things that 
we do to them and walk away from today's speech  

888
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:07,120
saying that you don't care the ethical compass 
that most people use to gauge right from wrong  

889
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:15,040
is the golden rule do unto others as you 
would have others do unto you since no one  

890
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:20,480
in this room wants to be treated the way we treat 
cows and pigs and chickens and turkeys and fish  

891
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:28,880
there's no need to search for an excuse 
today not to be vegan 60 billion land animals  

892
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:39,440
90 billion marine animals are killed every year on 
this planet for a sandwich for addictions of greed  

893
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:49,200
and gluttony what kind of society justifies mass 
murder stop thinking that animals aren't victims  

894
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:56,960
because they aren't human it's the mindset of the 
victimizer that's wrong and this is what needs to  

895
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:04,080
be examined and corrected because it never changes 
no matter who the victim is have you noticed it  

896
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:10,240
always goes something like this no you don't count 
no you don't matter no i'm more important than you  

897
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:14,880
i laugh at the suffering i inflict on you i'll 
kill you and your family whenever i want however i  

898
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:26,240
want prove to me why i should be kind to you it is 
not your right to deny someone else their freedom  

899
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:33,520
and their rights so you can harm them enslave them 
and kill them that's not what rights are about  

900
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:43,200
that's injustice there is no counter argument 
to veganism except that you can't be right all  

901
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:51,200
the time apologize for the way you've been 
living make amends and evolve move forward  

902
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:58,320
now all throughout history there's a pretty 
good reason why most people most good people  

903
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:03,840
have always been on the wrong side of what's 
right and that's because the truth has never been  

904
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:12,640
accepted overnight it always has to pass through 
three stages first it is mocked and ridiculed  

905
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:20,800
second stage denial and violent opposition 
people refuse people refuse to believe there's  

906
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:27,920
an atrocity taking place and they fight tooth 
and nail to keep the status quo as is third stage

907
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:37,600
acceptance there is no longer need to explain 
it because we all get it now unfortunately it  

908
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:44,480
usually takes hundreds sometimes thousands of 
years for the truth to pass through these stages  

909
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:48,320
i'm going to try and do it 
today in around 45 minutes  

910
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:54,880
and in order for the truth to be accepted and 
understood we do have to witness the atrocities  

911
01:53:55,600 --> 01:54:00,400
the five and a half minute video we're about to 
watch that footage was taken throughout america  

912
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:06,800
britain and israel and if you feel the need to 
turn away or close your eyes during this video  

913
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:12,400
you should probably ask yourself a question 
if it's not good enough for my eyes  

914
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:19,360
then why is it good enough for my stomach and 
before i press play i have to say something about  

915
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:26,640
all this humane meat humane milk humane eggs [ 
__ ] that's going on in our society right now  

916
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:34,320
that stuff does not exist under any circumstances 
whatsoever even when animals reside in cage-free  

917
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:42,080
free range grass-fed local organic antibiotic-free 
facilities by definition alone slavery and  

918
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:48,080
slaughter are radically cruel and can never 
be humane so don't be so gullible with slick  

919
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:53,760
marketing ads that want to convince you that 
animals enjoy being on the menu as if they're  

920
01:54:53,760 --> 01:55:00,720
all saying hey stab me yeah kill me sure take 
everything from me because that's why i'm here  

921
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:07,200
just for you and if for some reason my aforesaid 
words in this video we're about to watch  

922
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:14,240
aren't proof enough of the terrorism claims that 
i am hurling at the meat dairy and egg industries  

923
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:31,840
maybe the dismembered bodies of 150 billion 
animals annually could count as proof

924
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:33,840
do

925
01:58:50,480 --> 01:59:01,840
foreign

926
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:39,840
so

927
02:00:49,520 --> 02:01:00,960
i am forever embarrassed to be a human being to 
stand upright like that's something to be proud of

928
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:09,200
did you ever wonder why mcdonald's and burger 
king and wendy's never use those images in  

929
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:20,240
their tv ads no severed heads dismembered limbs 
corpses blood guts always showing you a happy  

930
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:29,360
singing smiling cartoon caricature 
instead lying to you brainwashing you  

931
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:36,000
and programming you not to care about 
things you would normally care about  

932
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:45,520
things that you used to care about when you were 
young innocent and uncorrupted by society's lies  

933
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:52,160
so how come if the animals in that video were 
dogs and cats people would be outraged and if they  

934
02:01:52,160 --> 02:02:01,440
were kids the world would scream bloody murder 
instead the victims are cows and chickens and fish  

935
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:08,960
and all of a sudden it's okay so i am a 
little confused here is the slaughterhouse  

936
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:14,880
the problem or is the problem just who's 
getting killed in the slaughterhouse  

937
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:25,840
because it's a house of slaughter why does it 
even exist especially when peace begins at the  

938
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:32,480
dinner table with what you put into your body on a 
daily basis good people don't talk about kindness  

939
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:41,440
they practice it and they certainly don't pray 
about love on the weekends for an hour or two they  

940
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:47,760
actually give it all the time i know you have 
the capability of understanding right from wrong  

941
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:54,080
because you all hate people who harm children why 
not hate people who harm animals it's hypocritical  

942
02:02:54,080 --> 02:03:01,920
why protect one victim and then violate and 
ignore the other victim when neither victim wants  

943
02:03:02,640 --> 02:03:12,560
nor deserves the abuse they just wish it would end 
stop praising the innocents in children and then  

944
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:19,520
ignoring and making fun of the exact same 
innocence in the animals and everyone has  

945
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:24,240
to stop making these idiotic claims that 
humans are the only ones who are capable  

946
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:30,560
of being rational and aware and that animals 
operate on instinct only can i explain something  

947
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:37,760
everybody in a pretty simple way breathing 
is instinctive everything else is a thought  

948
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:44,800
attached to an action it's not an accident 
that animals can build a home if given a chance  

949
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:51,680
and return to that home but they can care for 
their babies that they can find shade on a sunny  

950
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:59,840
day or seek warmth when it's cold figure out when 
to sleep or stay awake locate water to drink fly  

951
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:05,600
in a bee formation hide when they don't want to 
be seen defend their territories all these actions  

952
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:11,840
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that animals 
have the capacity of being rational and aware  

953
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:20,080
the human animal is the only animal that spends 
the majority of time not thinking eating at steak  

954
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:26,880
and shake in the golden corral and applebee's 
and long john silvers is not rational thought  

955
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:34,720
but this isn't a competition of intelligence or 
awareness this is about justice when we were kids  

956
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:39,840
each and every single one of us when our parents 
our grandparents sat us down and read us a story  

957
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:46,960
that story was about animals and when that 
story was read to us we smiled and giggled  

958
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:53,760
uncontrollably we even mimicked the noises they 
made their language we wanted to play with them  

959
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:59,040
so badly not have someone shove a knife in 
their throat and cut them up into pieces  

960
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:06,800
what happened to you along the way who 
stole your empathy and your conscience  

961
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:16,800
because they stole mine too and they got me good 
but i got it all back and that's the only reason  

962
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:23,360
i'm here today to try and help you get yours 
back as well most people eat dairy products three  

963
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:31,760
times a day but you can't even get a sandwich 
anymore without cheese people put cheese and meat  

964
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:37,440
on salads too and by the way if you're 
eating a salad with meat and cheese on it  

965
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:42,640
it's not a salad stop that [ __ ] it's a sandwich 
without the bread all chopped up little pieces put  

966
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:49,840
inside of a bowl spare me the chicken salad tuna 
salad crap a salad is comprised of vegetables and  

967
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:54,400
plant products only and if you're lucky enough 
to find this vegetable only salad somewhere  

968
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:57,280
what's the first thing people have 
to say to the waiter like an addict  

969
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:04,880
yeah hey uh can i get some ranch or some thousand 
island can you please pour some dairy all over  

970
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:11,200
these vegetables for me so in our society where 
everybody is hooked on dairy i mean hooked like  

971
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:17,840
it's been laced with cocaine and percocet most 
people can't even fathom one meal little in one  

972
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:23,040
day or a lifetime without cheese in fact if you 
want to know why vegetarians never become vegans  

973
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:30,960
cheese cheese on a baked potato cheese on a 
broccoli cheese on everything and say even  

974
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:35,760
lactose intolerant people eat cheese i want to 
spend a little more time right now condemning the  

975
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:41,040
dairy industry because when it comes to cruelty 
i think there's more cruelty in a piece of cheese  

976
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:49,600
and a glass of milk in yogurt than there is in 
meat first of all most hamburger meat comes from  

977
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:55,840
the dairy industry when cows can't produce 
huge amounts of milk after three to seven years  

978
02:06:56,800 --> 02:07:06,560
slaughterhouse if given a chance god forbid cows 
can live to be 18 to 25 and cows are like all  

979
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:11,120
female mammals listen i don't mean to be speaking 
down anybody if that's how you're taking this  

980
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,480
it's just that when i'm talking to addicts about 
their addictions addicts have a tendency to become  

981
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:21,760
irrational and illogical i know you understand 
this concept you just never think about it when  

982
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:32,000
it comes to the animals female mammals can only 
produce and give milk during or after pregnancy

983
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:41,920
so once a year every cow on every dairy farm 
is raped to impregnate her long steel device  

984
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:46,800
shoved in her vagina to inject her with bull 
scene and sometimes you just use a bare hand  

985
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:52,800
to do it got to get that milk flow going somehow 
and later on after she gives birth her newborn  

986
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:58,640
baby is stolen away a couple months later they 
repeat the process all over again one of the  

987
02:07:58,640 --> 02:08:04,320
worst screams i have ever heard and i've heard 
them all firsthand i've been to slaughterhouses  

988
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:08,400
vivisection labs behind the scenes of every 
circus and rodeo that were passed through michigan  

989
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:12,960
one of the worst screams i've ever heard 
stealing newborn babies from their mothers  

990
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:19,360
and why would they steal newborn babies from 
their moms well the dairy industry can't have  

991
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:24,800
calves sucking up all that milk that was meant 
for them and they'd rather sell it to you instead  

992
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:33,520
every time you have dairy some calf does 
not and mother cows make milk for one reason  

993
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:40,800
for their babies case clothes forever no debate 
no discussion the jury is in they certainly don't  

994
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:45,760
make milk for baby elephants and baby orangutans 
and baby hedgehogs baby rabbits baby rats baby  

995
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:54,080
humans adolescent humans or adult humans this 
body of ours has absolutely no need for cow milk  

996
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:59,520
like it has absolutely no need for giraffe 
milk and zebra milk and rhinoceros milk and  

997
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:04,800
hippopotamus milk chamomile goat milk horse milk 
pig milk dog milk or cat milk the only milk that  

998
02:09:04,800 --> 02:09:14,240
we ever need comes from our own mother our species 
that's it and after the first few years of life we  

999
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:18,880
never need one drop of milk ever again and don't 
think i don't watch your faces when i'm up here  

1000
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:24,720
that's what i do when i'm preaching i'm watching 
all your expressions how come when i talk about  

1001
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:30,720
tofu and pizzas without cheese boy catch a 
couple people in every classroom start to  

1002
02:09:30,720 --> 02:09:34,880
wrinkle up their noses a little eyes get a little 
wide and bold just start glancing around the room  

1003
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:40,880
with your friends like tofu is this good crazy 
tempeh must be out of his mind what the hell is  

1004
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:48,000
seitan seitan by the way not satan seitan it is 
wheat meat it is meat that is made from wheat  

1005
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,880
so how come tofu and even fruits and veggies 
are considered gross to most people but meat  

1006
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:58,080
time to break meat down for everybody 
you got five components to meat  

1007
02:09:58,080 --> 02:10:05,440
blood flesh veins muscles and tendons the 
cut up corpse of a dismembered body how  

1008
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:12,240
does meat not qualify as disgusting and gross to 
everybody how in the world is a liquid a liquid  

1009
02:10:12,240 --> 02:10:19,520
that oozes out of a cow's udder a secretion that's 
loaded with pus that drips from an animal's body  

1010
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:23,920
how is this not considered gross oh and let me 
tell you about the pus in the cow's milk it could  

1011
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:29,200
be my pleasure when you hook machines up to the 
udders of cows three times a day to suck them dry  

1012
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:33,280
those machines cause massive amounts of 
infections and irritations on the inside  

1013
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:38,640
and outside of the utter then when you add all 
the bovine growth hormone and all the genetic  

1014
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:41,600
engineering that's been done to a cow's body 
to make sure she produces huge amounts of milk  

1015
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:46,800
which always leads to another infection the 
machine doesn't know what not to suck out pus  

1016
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:52,720
and mucus and infections right into the milk 
and yes milk is pasteurized but exactly when  

1017
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:59,200
did pasteurization become a removal process 
last time i checked it was a sanitation process  

1018
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:06,320
meaning you're only sanitizing pus and if you 
want to look this up online well you don't think  

1019
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:12,560
the dairy industry would ever use the word pus 
when they write about this problem in their own  

1020
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:18,320
trade journals do you now they're going to deceive 
you again look up the scientific term for pus  

1021
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:25,040
somatic cell count s-o-m-a-t-i-c oh and 
let's talk about some other disgusting  

1022
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:30,720
things that you guys love to eat did you know 
that the back side of a bird is called a cloaca

1023
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:37,840
c-l-o-a-c-a it was the only scene in the video 
you could pop that back in if you want to see  

1024
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:48,880
it's one hole it is one whole but it serves 
many purposes it's the poop hole it's the pee  

1025
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:56,960
hole it's the vaginal fluid hole and it's the hole 
where your omelettes and scrambled eggs come from  

1026
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:01,120
yeah i remember back in the day used to love 
my scrambled eggs with [ __ ] sprinkles urine  

1027
02:12:01,120 --> 02:12:05,200
splattering goo juice all over it too because 
you know when you crack that shell over the  

1028
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:09,680
ball all those microscopic particles fly 
every which way and if you guys think it's  

1029
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:15,120
normal and natural to eat something that's been 
marinating in feces and urine for hours and hours  

1030
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:20,720
i got a brand new challenge for everybody i always 
like to have a new challenge every single semester  

1031
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:25,440
this is the egg challenge when you get home 
from school later today i want you go to the  

1032
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:34,160
bathroom fill her up everything don't flush 
though then i want you to stroll on over to  

1033
02:12:34,160 --> 02:12:39,680
the kitchen open up the fridge grab yourself 
an egg take it back to the toilet drop it in  

1034
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:46,000
if you even have the courage to stick your hand 
in there and grab it back out and you can wash  

1035
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,920
it when you're done bleach it do whatever you 
want to it are you still gonna want to eat it  

1036
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:55,840
and that's your own [ __ ] that's your waist now 
you're talking about a hand that you don't even  

1037
02:12:55,840 --> 02:13:03,280
know her butthole and what about vomit come on you 
guys love vama you adore some vomit in on and all  

1038
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:08,720
over your food better give this one a pretty name 
no no one's gonna want to buy any vomit unless we  

1039
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:15,680
call it honey instead honey comes directly from 
a bee's stomach it's regurgitated right through  

1040
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:20,080
a bee's mouth you can look that up with any 
wildlife biologist but nobody wants to eat  

1041
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:24,960
bee vomit nut cheerios we want honey nut cheerios 
so we lie to ourselves and play euphemism games  

1042
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:30,880
the standard diet of a meat dairy and egg eater is 
blood flesh veins muscles tendons cow secretions  

1043
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:36,640
things that come out of a hen's ass and b vomit 
and we're not done yet i'm not going to let you  

1044
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:40,720
off the hook that easily while i got you here 
today because we top it all off in my opinion  

1045
02:13:41,440 --> 02:13:48,160
because every single year when people start 
cooking turkeys for the holidays boy people take  

1046
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:53,200
a dead turkey carve out a really big hole in that 
dead turkey's ass take some stuffing and shove it  

1047
02:13:53,200 --> 02:13:59,120
inside their dead empty ass and use their little 
dead ass as an oven to bake some bread somebody  

1048
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:08,960
else's dead empty bacteria laying ass to make 
bread ass bread and people think vegans are weird  

1049
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:18,720
because we eat tofu i tell people one of 
my favorite meals nowadays yams and barley  

1050
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:25,840
hook me up with some yams and barley for 
breakfast lunch or dinner and i'm a happy guy  

1051
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:28,800
i know most people although i tell 
them this and they're like what  

1052
02:14:29,600 --> 02:14:34,240
you just eat vegetables and grains for dinner 
yeah i don't know man that's kind of weird  

1053
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:41,120
okay somebody else's rib cage sitting 
on your plate that's not weird  

1054
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:47,840
severed legs sliced up thighs and mutilated 
breasts on your plate isn't weird and doesn't  

1055
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:55,520
make you think twice is bestiality weird anybody 
doing sexual things with animals because i used  

1056
02:14:55,520 --> 02:15:00,480
to think everybody thought so but not even 
close my meat cheese milk egg loving friends  

1057
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:06,800
because you engage in carnivorous bestiality 
on a daily basis sometimes multiple times a day  

1058
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:10,560
you eat things that come out of the hen's 
ass and shove things into a turkey's ass  

1059
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:16,640
you eat breast legs and thighs and then you pay 
somebody else to sexually molest a cow and squeeze  

1060
02:15:16,640 --> 02:15:23,120
her nipples for you so you can steal her milk man 
you guys are obsessed with bird asses and cow tits

1061
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:33,040
enough already seriously is it 
possible to step into the 21st century  

1062
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:41,200
and stop mimicking the behavior of cavemen 
and cave women you got a choice today  

1063
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:47,040
when you leave this room you can choose 
to never intentionally harm another animal  

1064
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:52,000
for breakfast lunch or dinner ever again 
these animals have never violated you or  

1065
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:57,200
taken advantage of you in any way the 
least you can do is return the favor  

1066
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:06,560
or stay radically cruel keep the status quo as 
is make sure animals have their babies stolen  

1067
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:11,760
from them make sure their horns are cut off 
be sliced off testicles ripped out make sure  

1068
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:18,560
they're raped make sure they never experience 
one drop of human kindness and make sure there's  

1069
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:26,800
a knife in their throat every second of every 
minute of every hour of every day for eternity  

1070
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:34,000
i hope you make the right choice isn't it rough 
enough being an animal on this planet with us  

1071
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:43,280
around as we claim everything for us the 
land is ours we pollute the air the water  

1072
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:49,120
destroy the forest and the mountains do we have to 
maximize the cruelty that they already endure by  

1073
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:54,399
eating them on top of it all you want to talk 
about pouring salt into somebody else's wombs

1074
02:16:56,559 --> 02:17:06,080
98 and i want to leave you with this stat 98 of 
animals who are abused and killed on this planet  

1075
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:15,599
are abused and killed by the meat dairy and egg 
industries the least we can do is minimize the  

1076
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:22,318
cruelty by living a vegan lifestyle i want to 
thank you guys for listening i do appreciate  

1077
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:28,879
the open minds that's out there today hello 
everyone my name is kate timko before gary  

1078
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:33,519
begins with the formal presentation this evening 
i'd like everyone to stop and think for a moment  

1079
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:39,439
stop and think about the certain rights and 
freedoms that many human beings have just received  

1080
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:45,439
over the last 150 years now these are rights and 
freedoms that many of us take for granted we don't  

1081
02:17:45,439 --> 02:17:51,200
think about every single day for instance 150 
years ago and in the grand scheme of things really  

1082
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:59,519
that's just a blip but 150 years ago in america 
we still had slavery 100 years ago not one child  

1083
02:17:59,520 --> 02:18:07,120
in the united states had any rights whatsoever 85 
years ago women could not vote and 40 years ago  

1084
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:13,280
only 40 years ago segregation was still thriving 
in america meaning that black people could not  

1085
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:19,679
drink from the same water fountain as white people 
only 40 years ago now one of the most amazing  

1086
02:18:19,680 --> 02:18:26,478
traits that human beings possess is our short-term 
selective memory process now we do love to believe  

1087
02:18:26,478 --> 02:18:32,159
we've been good decent compassionate to each 
other for a very very long time but decency and  

1088
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:37,439
compassion are pretty much brand new concepts 
when it comes to the treatment of most human  

1089
02:18:37,439 --> 02:18:45,359
beings now it is our hope that in the next 150 
years we will all continue to evolve with decency  

1090
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:51,759
continue to evolve with compassion and extend it 
to the entire animal kingdom humans and animals  

1091
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:58,639
together the entire animal kingdom so if anyone 
came in today thinking animal rights is radical  

1092
02:18:58,639 --> 02:19:05,519
or extreme outrageous or maybe even silly please 
stop and think about those certain rights and  

1093
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:12,799
freedoms that human beings have just received over 
the last 150 years and then one could logically  

1094
02:19:12,799 --> 02:19:18,639
conclude that animals will be the next group of 
disenfranchised beings to obtain their freedom  

1095
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:24,478
so i guess it's safe to say that this room is full 
of people who eat meat i'm sure most people here  

1096
02:19:24,478 --> 02:19:29,918
own shoes or belts or jackets made from the 
skin of cows kate and i used to wear leather  

1097
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:37,120
shoes belts and jackets too and i ate meat for 25 
years k-8 meat 4 23 before i talk about veganism  

1098
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:42,478
in detail all the ethical and health reasons 
for living a vegan lifestyle and discuss what  

1099
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:48,079
it's like to be an animal in the food industry i 
want to talk about the blinders that everyone has  

1100
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:53,519
on blinders that kate and i used to have 
on too blinders that absolutely destroy  

1101
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:59,281
compassion blinders that make people unconcerned 
about cruelty and killing and blinders that  

1102
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:06,240
give some people the audacity to laugh and make 
jokes about the suffering of animals now those  

1103
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:11,519
blinders were not attached to us or anyone 
else with malice a forethought necessarily  

1104
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:16,720
but the truth has been hidden from us 
nonetheless today's speech will give you  

1105
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:23,600
the opportunity to write many horrible wrongs if 
you give us 60 minutes of an open mind tonight  

1106
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:28,000
we promise you will walk out of this 
room more ethical than when you came in  

1107
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:34,319
so instead of trying to find an excuse tonight 
not to be vegan we're sincerely asking that you  

1108
02:20:34,319 --> 02:20:40,639
find an excuse tonight to be vegan and i just 
want to clarify the word vegan for everybody  

1109
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:45,760
vegans and vegetarians don't consume 
the meat of any land or marine animal  

1110
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:51,200
but the difference between vegans and vegetarians 
is that vegans don't consume milk cheese eggs or  

1111
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:57,120
any animal product whatsoever and keep this 
in mind as well the best thing about veganism  

1112
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:03,840
there are millions of christian jewish muslim 
buddhist black white asian latino male female  

1113
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:10,479
pro-life pro-choice pro-gun and anti-gun vegans 
and millions of people who label themselves  

1114
02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:17,519
republicans or democrats or independents are 
vegan too matthew scully the senior speechwriter  

1115
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:24,399
for george w bush recently wrote a book called 
dominion it's a right-wing faith-based christian  

1116
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:29,439
conservative views supporting veganism 
and animal rights because your ethnicity  

1117
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:36,080
religious affiliation and political party have 
no bearing no bearing on eating a veggie burger  

1118
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:42,399
tonight instead of a hamburger you see if you 
honestly put yourself in the position of an animal  

1119
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:48,719
who is enslaved in the food industry confined to 
an artificial world denied your freedom denied the  

1120
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:54,240
right to live a long healthy life denied sunlight 
most of the time and then imagine yourself being  

1121
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:59,200
stuffed into a transport truck to be shipped to 
your death hung upside down by your legs at the  

1122
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:04,080
slaughterhouse so someone could cut your throat 
dismember your body so someone else could cook  

1123
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:11,600
it and eat it if you honestly put yourself in 
that animal's position there is no way you can  

1124
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:16,560
justify the things that we do to animals and 
walk away from today's speech saying that you  

1125
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:22,241
don't care the ethical compass that most people 
use to gauge right from wrong is the golden rule  

1126
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:28,000
treat others like you would want to be treated do 
unto others as you would have done unto you since  

1127
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:33,600
no one in this room wants to be treated like a 
cow a pig or a chicken there's really no reason to  

1128
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:39,600
search for an excuse tonight not to be vegan now 
we're going to show a graphic four minute video  

1129
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:45,600
about where food comes from at the slaughterhouse 
and the video you're going to see is the harsh  

1130
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:51,280
truth but i want everyone to remember throughout 
what german philosopher arthur schopenhauer once  

1131
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:56,639
said about truth schopenhauer stated that 
all truth everything that we hold to be true  

1132
02:22:56,640 --> 02:23:05,520
has to pass through three stages now first it is 
ridiculed second it is violently opposed and third  

1133
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:11,520
it is finally accepted as being self-evident so 
which stage of truth do you find yourself in now  

1134
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:17,840
and which stage of truth might you be in if 
you give us an open mind an hour from now

1135
02:23:38,319 --> 02:23:45,840
uh

1136
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:13,840
so

1137
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:41,840
um

1138
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:37,840
uh

1139
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:51,840
um

1140
02:25:54,640 --> 02:26:05,840
so

1141
02:26:37,600 --> 02:26:47,840
thank you

1142
02:26:56,640 --> 02:27:01,840
down

1143
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:15,840
so

1144
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:29,840
so

1145
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:51,120
now not that any law could ever alleviate 
the suffering and slaughter that you folks  

1146
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:56,399
just witnessed but i want to read an excerpt to 
everyone right now from the animal welfare act  

1147
02:27:56,399 --> 02:28:05,200
of 1966 this is a pathetic piece of legislation 
if and i say if if you can even call this a law  

1148
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:12,880
because the animal welfare act states verbatim 
that the term animal excludes birds rats  

1149
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:22,240
mice horses and other farm animals such as but not 
limited to livestock and poultry and anything used  

1150
02:28:22,240 --> 02:28:30,800
or intended to be used as food or clothing it also 
states that the term exhibitor excludes retail pet  

1151
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:38,720
stores organizations sponsoring state and county 
fairs livestock shows rodeos purebred dog and cat  

1152
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:45,040
shows and any fair or exhibition intended 
to advance agricultural arts and sciences  

1153
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:51,040
that's some law they've laid out for the animals 
but even if this animal welfare act decided to  

1154
02:28:51,040 --> 02:28:55,439
include all of the animals you just heard 
it leaves out i want to be clear about this  

1155
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:03,600
there is no peaceful compassionate way to shoot an 
animal between their eyes or slice their throats  

1156
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:10,160
it is the taking of an animal's life that is the 
ultimate violation all of the mutilations that  

1157
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:15,680
happen to these animals along the way which we're 
going to discuss in a moment only serve to prove  

1158
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:21,439
that animals have been reduced to objects they 
are mere commodities that have to meet certain  

1159
02:29:21,439 --> 02:29:28,319
specifications in order to maximize profits and 
during this speech when we say the word farm we  

1160
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:34,960
are not just speaking about factory farms we are 
talking about all farms factory free range organic  

1161
02:29:34,960 --> 02:29:43,280
and mom-and-pop farms because all farms that raise 
animals for food kill animals for food so all we  

1162
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:48,080
ask from here on out is that you folks give us 
an open mind and truly hear what we're about to  

1163
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:55,920
tell you now each year in the us we kill about 10 
billion land animals and 18 billion marine animals  

1164
02:29:55,920 --> 02:30:03,439
because people have acquired a taste for meat 
and i stress acquired a taste for meat worldwide  

1165
02:30:03,439 --> 02:30:10,719
the numbers are staggering about 45 to 50 billion 
land animals and about 85 billion marine animals  

1166
02:30:10,720 --> 02:30:16,560
are killed and eaten every year on this planet now 
in america we kill and eat more than 100 million  

1167
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:22,560
pigs every single year and for their entire lives 
the female pigs are locked up in tiny crates and  

1168
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:29,200
stalls so they can be forcibly impregnated against 
their will with long steel devices that shoot hog  

1169
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:35,280
semen into their uterus basically they are the 
unwilling baby machines of the meat industry  

1170
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:40,719
and when female pigs can no longer make babies 
after years of being forcibly impregnated  

1171
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:45,280
they're shipped off to the slaughterhouse and 
killed now meanwhile shortly after birth the  

1172
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:51,920
male piglets they have their tiny bodies mutilated 
in four horrific ways first somebody holds them  

1173
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:56,800
upside down and cuts their tail off without 
anesthetic because tail biting is common in  

1174
02:30:56,800 --> 02:31:03,120
the overcrowded unnatural conditions of today's 
farms and then each baby pig has anywhere from  

1175
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:08,960
two to eight teeth cut off they actually cut their 
teeth off down to the gum line with a pair of wire  

1176
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:13,840
cutter like devices so when they go to fight and 
bite each other there are no teeth to damage the  

1177
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:20,080
flesh and since female pigs are forced to produce 
twice as many piglets in captivity than they  

1178
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:25,680
would in the wild teeth cutting is also a big 
money maker for the meat industry cutting teeth  

1179
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:31,439
allows the mother to nurse even more piglets who 
will eventually be killed for profit because when  

1180
02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:36,719
the babies suckle without teeth wear and tear 
on the mother's nipples is kept to a minimum  

1181
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:40,880
and they're always marking pigs to keep track 
of them so they rip out portions of their ears  

1182
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:46,800
it's called ear notching and then finally in 
a sick attempt and i repeat a sick attempt to  

1183
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:53,600
pacify the industry-induced anger of the male pigs 
their testicles are ripped out as well and that's  

1184
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:59,920
castration without anesthetic now castration 
also gives the meat industry complete control  

1185
02:31:59,920 --> 02:32:07,920
over reproduction because natural reproduction in 
the meat industry in this day and age is obsolete  

1186
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:14,800
neither god nor evolution created 10 billion 
land animals in this country alone every year  

1187
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:20,880
human beings did that and that is because every 
aspect of raising animals for food is controlled  

1188
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:26,160
from genetic engineering and artificial 
insemination to quoting and killing  

1189
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:31,280
this is why many females empathize with the 
animal rights movement and practice veganism  

1190
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:39,120
humanitarian patrice jones once explained that 
women and animals along with land and children  

1191
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:45,599
have historically been seen as the property of 
male households women and animals are viewed as  

1192
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:52,480
less rational and both suffer by being reduced 
to their bodies or even worse their body parts  

1193
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:59,679
now of the 10 billion land animals killed and 
eaten in america every year about 9 billion 9  

1194
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:07,040
billion of those are chickens on egg farms they'll 
stuff anywhere from five to eleven hens into each  

1195
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:13,920
tiny battery cage with that many hens in a single 
cage you can imagine fighting is very common  

1196
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:20,560
which is why these hens have the top two thirds of 
their beaks sliced off it's called de-beaking they  

1197
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:27,040
actually slice off a portion of the beak with 
a red-hot blade heated to 800 degrees celsius  

1198
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:32,640
so that when they go to fight and peck each other 
they have no beaks to damage each other's flesh  

1199
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:38,399
and with chemicals and other drugs that are 
injected into their feed each hen is forced to  

1200
02:33:38,399 --> 02:33:45,439
produce around 300 eggs every year until of course 
her egg production tapers off and then she's  

1201
02:33:45,439 --> 02:33:52,799
killed without exception each and every egg-laying 
hen is killed so egg farms will also breed birds  

1202
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:58,240
so there's always a fresh supply of hens to lay 
the eggs but if babies in the hatchery turn out  

1203
02:33:58,240 --> 02:34:03,599
to be male pretty obvious they're completely 
useless to an egg industry and they are killed  

1204
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:09,920
off instantly they're either thrown into the 
trash alive and crying out for their lost mothers  

1205
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:15,760
or they're thrown into huge rendering machines 
alive so that they can be ground up and used  

1206
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:21,680
as feed for other animals on chicken farms 
they'll have anywhere between twenty thousand  

1207
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:28,160
and thirty thousand birds in each building 
after six or seven weeks of concentration camp  

1208
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:35,519
like conditions and living in tons of feces and 
urine they are killed too their bodies are then  

1209
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:41,840
soaked in a chlorine bath to remove the slime and 
odor off their carcasses and then placed on your  

1210
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:48,640
dinner plate see no one wants to admit it but 
eating meat really does mean eating a dead body  

1211
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:54,719
and eating meat means that your body has been 
reduced to nothing more than a walking graveyard  

1212
02:34:54,720 --> 02:35:01,040
of murdered animals and very quickly i want 
to destroy this myth about free-range farms  

1213
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:07,040
now according to government regulations free-range 
chickens raised for their flesh or for their eggs  

1214
02:35:07,040 --> 02:35:13,439
are only required to have access to an outside 
area meaning that most of these birds never  

1215
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:19,040
even get to see the light of day because having 
access and actually being allowed getting to go  

1216
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:24,399
outside are two completely different things 
now even if these birds manage to fight their  

1217
02:35:24,399 --> 02:35:29,920
way outside these outside areas they're given 
are usually no bigger than a standard backyard  

1218
02:35:30,479 --> 02:35:35,200
so that's a few thousand chickens in a single 
backyard how much happy space would you have  

1219
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:41,840
if you had to share your backyard with a few 
thousand people the term free range is a scam and  

1220
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:47,120
all free range chickens end up dead anyway they 
really don't seem that free to me but the term  

1221
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:52,880
free range is used to trick people into believing 
that meat and egg production can be done happily  

1222
02:35:52,880 --> 02:36:00,000
and humanely but really the only happy and humane 
way is just not to kill them i want to talk about  

1223
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:06,479
cattle ranching for a moment because each year 
in america we kill and eat about 37 million cows  

1224
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:12,000
and at first these animals are allowed to graze on 
large grassy fields for about six months but after  

1225
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:18,880
that it's straight to the feedlot where there's 
no grass no enclosed shelter just dirt and piles  

1226
02:36:18,880 --> 02:36:24,960
and piles and piles of manure and these feedlots 
have anywhere from a few hundred to a hundred  

1227
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:31,280
thousand cows there now for about ten months on 
the feed lot the cows get fed corn and protein  

1228
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:36,479
supplements to fatten them up quickly but 
many other things get mixed into their feed  

1229
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:44,559
many things you should be aware of many nasty 
things like manure animal blood and the ground  

1230
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:49,040
up bodies of animals who didn't grow quickly 
enough are the ones that died from disease  

1231
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:53,439
before they reach the slaughterhouse the 
downed animals this is why mad cow disease and  

1232
02:36:53,439 --> 02:36:59,359
other animal diseases like avian bird flu should 
concern everyone who eats meat because it is still  

1233
02:36:59,359 --> 02:37:05,120
perfectly legal and the standard operating 
procedure of the meat industry to feed the  

1234
02:37:05,120 --> 02:37:11,840
diseased ground up bodies of horses pigs chickens 
and turkeys back to the cows the sheep and the  

1235
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:18,319
goats and vice versa anything to save a buck now 
turkeys and ducks and sheep and other animals  

1236
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:24,160
they go through the same barbaric treatment too 
like chickens turkeys have a portion of their  

1237
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:29,200
beak sliced off of the red hot blade while 
ducks and geese have long steel poles shoved  

1238
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:35,040
down their throats to force feed them to fatten 
up their livers to ten times their natural size  

1239
02:37:35,040 --> 02:37:42,160
after killing them their liver is then turned 
into a pate known as foie gras and sheep in the  

1240
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:47,519
wool industry when these gentle creatures can 
no longer produce good quality wool any more  

1241
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:52,560
profitable to the clothing industry they're killed 
too because bottom line when it's time to make a  

1242
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:58,800
profit off an animal or that animal's body is 
no longer profitable the meat dairy egg and  

1243
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:04,160
clothing industries always always put a bullet 
between the animal's eyes or slice their throat

1244
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:12,319
now of the 18 billion marine animals that are 
killed and eaten in america every year many  

1245
02:38:12,319 --> 02:38:17,519
of them believe it or not were raised on fish 
farms where they were genetically engineered  

1246
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:23,680
fish farm salmon they have fish farms nowadays 
miracles of science the rest of these aquatic  

1247
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:27,760
animals are either hooked by the mouth or 
they're netted in huge trawlers which are  

1248
02:38:27,760 --> 02:38:33,359
basically just giant high-powered vacuum cleaners 
and they'll suck up catch and kill anything and  

1249
02:38:33,359 --> 02:38:38,719
everything that happens to be in its path now 
to demonstrate to you folks why we believe that  

1250
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:44,320
fishing is cruel violent and unethical we've 
come up with an analogy to help you empathize  

1251
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:50,000
now imagine for a moment that you're taking 
a walk on a warm pretty bright sunny day  

1252
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:54,080
down a nice dirt country back 
road and you spot an apple tree  

1253
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:58,399
fruit tree and you're hungry you've been walking 
for a while so you reach up for a piece of fruit  

1254
02:38:58,399 --> 02:39:04,160
but suddenly your hand is impaled by a large 
metal hook that pulls you and drags you now  

1255
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:09,439
please keep in mind that's the whole entire weight 
of your body pulling and dragging on your one hand  

1256
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:15,759
pulling and dragging you out of the air and 
into an atmosphere in which you cannot breathe  

1257
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:21,760
see that is exactly what aquatic animals 
experience when they're removed from their  

1258
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:27,760
watery habitats folks all we're really asking 
of you of anyone that we ever do this lecture  

1259
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:34,399
for to actually do is just eat what comes from 
the ground okay that's it and believe me it is  

1260
02:39:34,399 --> 02:39:41,439
natural it is full of vitamins minerals nutrients 
protein calcium iron potassium anything and  

1261
02:39:41,439 --> 02:39:46,479
everything that the human body needs comes from 
the ground really that's where it all comes from  

1262
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:51,519
fruits and vegetables nuts seeds grains legumes 
tofu even though i know that's still a funny word  

1263
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:58,240
to a lot of people see these things cannot harm 
you now when you eat what walks on the ground  

1264
02:39:58,240 --> 02:40:05,120
that is unnatural it is full of death disease 
and violence the human body does not get what  

1265
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:11,280
it needs from a meat-based diet diseases come 
and have been proven to come time and time again  

1266
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:16,639
from meat and dairy and i'm still looking for the 
first medical report in history that can indict  

1267
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:23,359
broccoli or bananas or carrots or apples as a 
cause of illness i want to take a few moments  

1268
02:40:23,359 --> 02:40:28,960
now and destroy this myth about human beings being 
on top of the food chain because tools and weapons  

1269
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:34,240
power and intelligence have not magically 
transformed our physiology and turned us into  

1270
02:40:34,240 --> 02:40:41,439
carnivores or omnivores sharks lions tigers bears 
wolves hyenas jackals even most dogs could easily  

1271
02:40:41,439 --> 02:40:48,080
kill a human being in fact most herbivores like 
rhinos elephants hippos horses bulls and gorillas  

1272
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:53,519
could easily kill a human being if provoked these 
animals have always been ahead of us on the food  

1273
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:59,040
chain because killing during a one-on-one 
confrontation without the use of weapons  

1274
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:04,479
and the ability to consume bloody raw flesh right 
from the bone without the side effect of disease  

1275
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:10,720
have always been the only two true factors in 
determining placement on the food chain this  

1276
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:16,479
is why most medical experts will attest to the 
fact that human beings are completely herbivorous  

1277
02:41:16,479 --> 02:41:22,479
creatures dr william roberts editor-in-chief of 
the american journal of cardiology states quite  

1278
02:41:22,479 --> 02:41:28,639
simply human beings are not natural carnivores 
because when we kill animals to eat them  

1279
02:41:29,279 --> 02:41:36,319
they end up killing us because their flesh was 
never intended for human beings who are natural  

1280
02:41:36,319 --> 02:41:42,000
herbivores the dairy industry has done a pretty 
masterful job at convincing most people that cows  

1281
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:47,439
naturally give milk i really hope you don't 
believe that i still come across children to this  

1282
02:41:47,439 --> 02:41:53,519
day you know the age-old we've got to milk them 
and they'll explode female cows are like any other  

1283
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:59,600
female mammal on this planet they only give milk 
during and after pregnancy which is why every year  

1284
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:05,200
like clockwork they are artificially inseminated 
it keeps their milk flow going and within a few  

1285
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:12,240
days of giving birth their babies are stolen from 
them they are breaking up families now they steal  

1286
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:16,880
their babies from them at birth because from a 
business standpoint you can't have a whole bunch  

1287
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:22,399
of little baby cows sucking up all the precious 
milk they want to sell to us humans where do male  

1288
02:42:22,399 --> 02:42:29,279
babies go on a dairy farm males obviously don't 
give milk completely useless but unlike the male  

1289
02:42:29,279 --> 02:42:35,120
baby chicks they've discovered a use for them they 
are shipped off to the veal farm where they're put  

1290
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:40,319
in tiny little crates and kept in the dark to keep 
them quiet ropes and chains around their necks to  

1291
02:42:40,319 --> 02:42:46,719
keep keep them completely immobilized see that 
is why veal is such a tender meat no movement is  

1292
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:51,760
ever allowed on behalf of these animals because 
no muscle development is ever allowed they want  

1293
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:57,520
these animals to get to a large weight more meat 
to sell but still retain their infant white flesh  

1294
02:42:58,240 --> 02:43:03,200
but if you knew all of that about veal and you 
don't eat it because you feel for little baby boy  

1295
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:08,880
cows and i mean really who wouldn't if you don't 
eat veal but you do drink milk and eat cheese  

1296
02:43:09,439 --> 02:43:15,839
eat veal you can eat veal to your heart's content 
because it doesn't make a bit of difference the  

1297
02:43:15,840 --> 02:43:22,080
veal industry is only in existence because of the 
dairy industry and once again that's their words  

1298
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:27,359
not mine and we kind of talked about this already 
but everyone in this room knows why a cow really  

1299
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:33,839
makes milk right a mother cow makes milk for her 
babies so cow's milk is meant for a baby cow just  

1300
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:40,640
like human milk is meant for a baby human the 
human body has no more need for cow's milk than  

1301
02:43:40,640 --> 02:43:48,080
we do for dog milk giraffe milk rhinoceros milk 
zebra milk i promise you there will come a day  

1302
02:43:48,960 --> 02:43:56,240
when our grandchildren will ask us where were you 
during the animal holocaust and what did you do  

1303
02:43:56,240 --> 02:44:01,599
to stop these horrifying crimes will you be 
able to say that you stood up against oppression  

1304
02:44:02,319 --> 02:44:05,759
even when doing so was 
considered radical or unpopular  

1305
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:13,200
so please please reevaluate your belief systems 
ask yourself why is all this violence against  

1306
02:44:13,200 --> 02:44:19,279
animals being permitted for what reasons we 
hope you'll have the same revelation that we did  

1307
02:44:19,279 --> 02:44:23,920
that non-violence through veganism 
non-violence through animal liberation  

1308
02:44:23,920 --> 02:44:31,840
is the only ethical and acceptable way to live 
on this planet thank you very much for listening  

1309
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:40,560
i just recently read this story about this nazi 
his name was ernst gerbel he and his men were  

1310
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:47,840
executing children one day but he didn't like the 
way his guards were grabbing kids by their hair  

1311
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:55,200
before they shot him in the back of the head and 
tossed him in a mass grave he actually ordered his  

1312
02:44:55,200 --> 02:45:03,279
men to stop grabbing the kids by their hair 
and i quote kill them in a more decent way  

1313
02:45:05,279 --> 02:45:11,359
that story sickens me as much as the stories 
that meat cheese milk and egg eaters love to  

1314
02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:18,559
tell hey gary i only eat free range freedom eggs 
hey gary i only eat animals who are raised and  

1315
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:27,279
killed humanely on a cage-free organic farm there 
is no such thing as humane when it comes to meat  

1316
02:45:27,279 --> 02:45:38,880
cheese milk and eggs humane slaughter humane rape 
humane slavery humane holocaust do not exist and  

1317
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:46,560
if for some reason my aforesaid words and the 
video we just watched aren't proof enough of  

1318
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:53,920
the terrorism claims that i am loving against the 
meat dairy and egg industries and humanity itself  

1319
02:45:55,279 --> 02:46:01,679
i don't know maybe the billions of dead 
dismembered animal bodies could count  

1320
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:11,519
as proof peace begins at the dinner table with 
what you put into your body on a daily basis good  

1321
02:46:11,520 --> 02:46:20,400
people don't talk about kindness they practice it 
they don't pray about love they actually give it  

1322
02:46:21,279 --> 02:46:27,599
i know you have the capability of understanding 
right from wrong because you all hate people  

1323
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:35,760
who harm children why not despise people who 
harm animals it's hypocritical why protect one  

1324
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:44,080
and violate the other when neither one wants nor 
deserves the abuse they just wish it would end

1325
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:51,840
up

1326
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:05,840
foreign

1327
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:11,920
uh you will hear the translation in your  

1328
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:15,279
ear and when we talk to you we'll 
translate simultaneously as best

1329
02:47:31,120 --> 02:47:33,840
foreign

1330
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:47,840
foreign

1331
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:27,440
one of the fears of the ministry of 
education is the way that you choose to um to  

1332
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:35,439
provoke your agenda i think and in schools they 
might they might think that it's inappropriate  

1333
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:40,879
what do you think first of all i'm here to speak 
on behalf of the most oppressed most abused most  

1334
02:49:40,880 --> 02:49:46,560
murdered group of beings that has ever existed the 
animals i speak against speciesism in the same way  

1335
02:49:46,560 --> 02:49:52,160
nelson mandela spoke against racism in the same 
way dr martin luther king and malcolm x and rosa  

1336
02:49:52,160 --> 02:49:58,479
parks spoke against the evils of racism and when 
we teach children that the jewish holocaust was  

1337
02:49:58,479 --> 02:50:04,080
evil but then we send animals to their death to 
the slaughterhouses and the same extermination  

1338
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:09,519
trucks that sent jews to their death we're 
committing a gross error we're teaching them that  

1339
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:16,479
it's okay to disregard animal life that human life 
is more sacred than animals when every creature on  

1340
02:50:16,479 --> 02:50:22,000
this planet values their life just like humans 
value their life there's nothing wrong with it

1341
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:35,840
because

1342
02:50:52,319 --> 02:50:58,080
do you want to call kids murderers or their 
parents murderers in their faces in their schools  

1343
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:02,960
i call human beings murderers of animals that's 
what we do that's the truth the truth is harsh  

1344
02:51:02,960 --> 02:51:07,120
i understand it's tough for people to look 
in the mirror and say my goodness i've been  

1345
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:11,920
doing something wrong for so long but there's 
nothing wrong with admitting that you've been  

1346
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:17,680
doing something wrong and to make amends and move 
forward but my question is kids that maybe choose  

1347
02:51:17,680 --> 02:51:23,920
to be vegetarians from now on but will think 
that their parents are murderers i mean you you  

1348
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:32,880
maybe you will destroy all the or the um you'll 
destroy the family in a way to save the family  

1349
02:51:32,880 --> 02:51:37,680
maybe the kids can teach their parents something 
for a change because parents don't know everything  

1350
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:42,479
and i'm tired of everybody thinking mommy 
and daddy know how the world works mommy and  

1351
02:51:42,479 --> 02:51:47,279
daddy are just as clueless about the world as 
everyone else but mommy and daddy are murderers  

1352
02:51:47,920 --> 02:51:59,840
and if 60 billion land animals end up cut into 
pieces what is it if it's not murder a party

1353
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:47,760
yeah so gary you came here for three 
weeks to give endless lectures in schools  

1354
02:52:47,760 --> 02:52:51,520
now you don't have the lectures what you're going 
to do now i do have lectures i have lectures in  

1355
02:52:51,520 --> 02:52:56,160
colleges i have lectures at auditorium set up 
and i'd like to know if you want to ask her  

1356
02:52:56,160 --> 02:53:02,000
in hebrew what's the effect of lying to kids and 
hiding the truth to kids we wonder why humans are  

1357
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:06,560
such a messed up species we can't get along with 
each other we have wars we have discrimination  

1358
02:53:06,560 --> 02:53:13,200
we have sexism heterosexism anti-semitism it's 
because we don't teach that speciesism is evil  

1359
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:20,399
and it's the root of all hatred all the branches 
of hatred racism and sexism stem from speciesism  

1360
02:53:20,399 --> 02:53:26,319
what's wrong with teaching the truth the school 
is supposed to be a place of learning of education  

1361
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:33,359
not deceit and propaganda which is what they do 
they teach kids that it's okay to rape animals and  

1362
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:38,799
steal their babies and kill them and sell their 
flesh and skin they tell kids that it's okay to  

1363
02:53:38,800 --> 02:53:45,520
eat things that come out of a hen's ass they tell 
kids it's okay to eat things that drip from animal  

1364
02:53:45,520 --> 02:53:51,041
utters they tell kids it's okay to eat flesh 
and blood and people are upset with me we'll try

1365
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:47,840
is

1366
02:55:55,040 --> 02:55:57,840
is

1367
02:55:59,680 --> 02:56:19,040
foreign hello gary good afternoon welcome 
to the show uh glad to have you here uh  

1368
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:25,600
quite an astonishing relationship with the israeli 
community you are developing right absolutely  

1369
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:30,880
beautiful tell me about it i mean it's amazing 
what's going on here people are listening to the  

1370
02:56:30,880 --> 02:56:35,680
speech it's the most viewed speech in the history 
of israel which is pretty amazing considering  

1371
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:42,800
what's been going on here for the last 50 60 70 
years i find that people who have been oppressed  

1372
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:46,080
certainly understand oppression more 
than others so i think that's why  

1373
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:49,279
israelis are really taking to 
this message of animal liberation  

1374
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:55,439
and it's thrilling to know that people are paying 
attention and making massive change try to compare  

1375
02:56:55,439 --> 02:57:01,359
it to to what's happening in other places like in 
the states or in europe can you compare it well  

1376
02:57:01,359 --> 02:57:06,559
it's definitely more people are paying attention 
here than in america america does have a lot of  

1377
02:57:06,560 --> 02:57:11,600
vegan food a lot of vegan mock meats a lot of 
vegan dairy products so there's more vegan food  

1378
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:18,160
there but more people seem to be interested in 
veganism here more people are making that change  

1379
02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:23,840
though i understand that you didn't get permission 
to speak in front of high school students it's  

1380
02:57:23,840 --> 02:57:27,840
kind of par for the course same thing back in 
america it's really not different here but it is  

1381
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:33,520
it is sad that we can't talk to kids about the 
truth about what's going on in the world that we  

1382
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:39,760
treat these teenagers like they're babies they're 
not babies they need to understand what's going on  

1383
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:45,359
and when you hide the truth from people then you 
have atrocities yeah maybe maybe but maybe the  

1384
02:57:45,359 --> 02:57:51,359
right place is not in schools but you know after 
afternoon lectures and evening lectures might be  

1385
02:57:52,800 --> 02:57:58,399
so who is your audience in the states in 
israel mainly in the states yes college  

1386
02:57:58,399 --> 02:58:04,000
students for sure college students i only 
give lectures to in colleges in america i  

1387
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:10,720
just finished doing 89 lectures in 12 states 
okay i understand that just a few days ago  

1388
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:17,359
you had a very uh strong recollection of the last 
time you've been to a slaughterhouse yeah can you  

1389
02:58:17,359 --> 02:58:22,799
tell me about it in 2007 i actually went to an 
auction house this is my first time i went to a  

1390
02:58:22,800 --> 02:58:27,439
place where the auction off animals i had been 
to dozens of slaughterhouses over the years but  

1391
02:58:27,439 --> 02:58:32,879
i wanted to see this place it was open to the 
public so i did not have to sneak around and  

1392
02:58:32,880 --> 02:58:37,520
break it at three in the morning so i walked 
right in i had a camera with me i went backstage  

1393
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:44,080
that day they were auctioning off sheep and cows 
now first of all they had the males spray painted  

1394
02:58:44,080 --> 02:58:50,960
on their back blue to mark them and the females 
pink the same markings that we've done to humans  

1395
02:58:50,960 --> 02:58:57,520
over the years with those atrocities which we can 
talk about later what really was disturbing to me  

1396
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:01,041
and saddening to me was the first 
time the animals didn't recognize  

1397
02:59:01,840 --> 02:59:05,840
who i was and why i was there over the years 
every time i went somewhere it was like they  

1398
02:59:05,840 --> 02:59:10,399
knew i was there for them and i'm like i'm getting 
footage i'm going to show people what's going on  

1399
02:59:10,399 --> 02:59:16,319
and i'm going to share this with the world well 
this was the day that they were just terrified  

1400
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:21,519
about what was going on and they turned their 
backs to me and they were shaking and shivering  

1401
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:26,640
and as they looked back it was like they were 
saying what are you doing to me now where are  

1402
02:59:26,640 --> 02:59:34,399
you taking me now why are you stealing me away 
from my family again leave me alone you two-legged  

1403
02:59:34,399 --> 02:59:40,639
devil just leave me alone and here i am going 
wait no i i'm gonna help i'm just showing people  

1404
02:59:40,640 --> 02:59:47,520
what's going on and they didn't recognize me and 
this is where my anger emanates from when people  

1405
02:59:48,319 --> 02:59:53,279
don't want to listen to the message this is why 
vegans get so militant because i don't want to be  

1406
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:59,120
a two-legged devil to the animals or to anybody 
i don't want to be vicious and mean and callous  

1407
02:59:59,120 --> 03:00:06,080
and vile but as a species we are so callous 
towards the animals that's how they view us  

1408
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:11,600
and it brings to mind a quote that made me go 
vegan way back in the day from a bishop from  

1409
03:00:12,319 --> 03:00:18,080
england william ralph inge inge in 
an 18th century sermon this man said  

1410
03:00:18,720 --> 03:00:25,439
that we have treated our cousins in fur and 
feathers so horribly that beyond a doubt  

1411
03:00:25,439 --> 03:00:30,559
if they ever formed an organized religion 
the devil would be depicted in human form  

1412
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:37,200
that broke my heart the day i read it and it still 
breaks my heart today because again they must look  

1413
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:42,800
at us like we are devils we cut things off their 
bodies their horns while they're fully conscious  

1414
03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:48,640
off the cows we cut the beaks off of hens we rip 
the testicles out of baby pigs when they're born  

1415
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:55,359
we torment them put them on concentration camp 
trucks we send them to slaughterhouses they know  

1416
03:00:55,359 --> 03:01:00,719
what's going on they're aware they're conscious 
they smell death and fear and blood in the air  

1417
03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:08,400
we cut them up into pieces this ad this this stuff 
has to stop over and over again once and again uh  

1418
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:21,040
you um go to uh ways of of describing that we are 
used to you to to to hear concerning the holocaust  

1419
03:01:22,399 --> 03:01:28,960
it's uh pretty sensitive around here 
but you you stand for it uh isn't it  

1420
03:01:29,600 --> 03:01:38,160
over the top to uh to uh use the holocaust the 
animal holocaust was happening long before the  

1421
03:01:38,160 --> 03:01:43,439
jewish holocaust during the jewish holocaust and 
it's still happening today i find it over the top  

1422
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:49,920
that the jewish holocaust is compared to the 
animal holocaust because when you compare numbers  

1423
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:54,640
we're talking about six million jews and if you 
add up the other six million gypsies and blacks  

1424
03:01:54,640 --> 03:01:59,600
and catholics and mentally [ __ ] people we're 
talking 12 million people were killed by the nazis  

1425
03:02:00,319 --> 03:02:09,120
in one year alone on this planet 60 billion land 
animals 90 billion marine animals are tortured  

1426
03:02:09,120 --> 03:02:16,240
tormented and killed in the world's most massive 
holocaust that's just in one year alone in america  

1427
03:02:16,240 --> 03:02:23,760
today 30 million land animals will be tortured in 
chicago in one day one day alone that is a massive  

1428
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:30,080
holocaust and jews don't own the term holocaust 
i know jewish people like to think it's our term  

1429
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:33,680
like black people like to think that they own 
slavery and i have to say i hate to admit that  

1430
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:43,760
the numbers are more than impressive but uh the 
moral argument um is is quite uh difficult because  

1431
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:50,480
one of my colleagues here asked you were you 
two uh to decide ilana dayan asked you that  

1432
03:02:51,120 --> 03:02:57,920
and i listened to your answer and i want to go 
back there she asked you if you had a three years  

1433
03:02:57,920 --> 03:03:06,479
old baby and a three-year-old puppy that you have 
to save one of them would you choose i think it's  

1434
03:03:06,479 --> 03:03:11,279
a horrible question to be asking somebody and 
when i asked her back would she save a black  

1435
03:03:11,279 --> 03:03:17,759
baby or a white baby would you save a palestinian 
suicide bomber or would you save a flea because  

1436
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:23,920
we act like human life is valuable and it's not 
especially when you talk about mass murderers and  

1437
03:03:23,920 --> 03:03:29,840
rapists and hitler and himmler and stalin and idi 
amin and slobodan milosevic and muammar gaddafi  

1438
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:34,319
i mean is anybody going to save muammar qaddafi's 
life how come people didn't come to his rescue  

1439
03:03:34,319 --> 03:03:39,439
when they pulled him out of a sewer and took a 
knife and shoved it in his anus nobody cares about  

1440
03:03:39,439 --> 03:03:46,160
gaddafi osama bin laden this is so false we are 
all speciesists we think that animal life isn't  

1441
03:03:46,160 --> 03:03:52,240
valuable and we falsely believe that human life 
is valuable if i can further explain how how how  

1442
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:58,880
unvaluable human life truly is do you know that 
if you took humans off this planet the extinction  

1443
03:03:58,880 --> 03:04:04,160
of humans would benefit everything that exists the 
animals the forest the air the water the mountains  

1444
03:04:04,160 --> 03:04:11,760
we are completely not special to this planet if 
you removed ants this is how special ants are the  

1445
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:16,160
whole ecosystem would collapse without ants and 
i know you've been following the news with bees  

1446
03:04:17,120 --> 03:04:24,319
if the bees disappear everything falls apart this 
is how special and valuable bees are to the world  

1447
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:31,600
where do we get off saying that we are valuable 
when all we do is destroy and torment and think  

1448
03:04:31,600 --> 03:04:38,319
that we're superior and we dominate others and 
this is why you wished you said you wish that  

1449
03:04:38,319 --> 03:04:43,040
people that work in slaughterhouses and get 
slaughtered themselves or something very bad  

1450
03:04:43,040 --> 03:04:48,960
happens to them listen i wish evil on evil people 
all the time and any sane person would do the same  

1451
03:04:48,960 --> 03:04:55,120
thing was anybody upset when the nazi hunters went 
track down at all people like men and brought them  

1452
03:04:55,120 --> 03:05:01,200
back here and killed people that work in some 
party in the streets i like nazis sure to the to  

1453
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:06,000
their victims they are really doesn't matter what 
i think to you to me yes but most importantly to  

1454
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:12,319
the victims the victims don't see the people that 
killed jews any different than the people who kill  

1455
03:05:12,319 --> 03:05:19,519
cows and people that were furs should be raped 
i wish listen i certainly don't wish that they  

1456
03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:25,279
hit the lottery i don't wish that bags of money 
fall from the sky and boxes of lollipops land  

1457
03:05:25,279 --> 03:05:30,399
in their laps i wish evil things happen to evil 
people but i want to be clear about this i hope  

1458
03:05:30,399 --> 03:05:36,879
rapists get raped i hope child molesters get raped 
i hope all the evil people in the world have evil  

1459
03:05:36,880 --> 03:05:41,600
done upon them so maybe they can for the first 
time in their lives understand what it means  

1460
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:47,440
to be treated like nothing i don't understand 
why my wishes are worse than people's actions  

1461
03:05:48,479 --> 03:05:52,719
people that eat meat dairy and eggs 
people that wear fur coats that support  

1462
03:05:52,720 --> 03:05:57,359
vivisection that do vivisection i tell you why 
it's important i tell you why it's important  

1463
03:05:57,359 --> 03:06:03,759
because maybe someone hears you right now and 
will take action which will be which will be  

1464
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:09,120
violent which will be a murder a killing okay 
two things do you know when i made that statement  

1465
03:06:10,479 --> 03:06:17,519
1997. okay it's been 16 years and not one 
person has raped a woman in a fur coat because i  

1466
03:06:17,520 --> 03:06:24,399
wished it all right okay so let's not get into 
people taking my words that literally it was my  

1467
03:06:24,399 --> 03:06:30,000
wish it was my fantasy and by the way i also 
wrote three other lines about how rapists  

1468
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:35,760
should be used in experiments how rapists should 
be tortured and killed how come people don't talk  

1469
03:06:35,760 --> 03:06:41,040
about those things that i say nobody disagrees 
with my position on violence they just only  

1470
03:06:41,040 --> 03:06:47,519
disagree with who i propose to be violent 
for see everybody thinks it's okay to kill  

1471
03:06:47,520 --> 03:06:53,359
nazis on behalf of jews okay to kill a white slave 
owner on behalf of a black slave but nobody thinks  

1472
03:06:53,359 --> 03:07:00,080
it's okay to kill a chicken murderer on behalf 
of a chicken so that's the issue at hand is why  

1473
03:07:00,080 --> 03:07:06,399
do we devalue the life of a chicken and why do 
we value human life so because nature is full of  

1474
03:07:06,960 --> 03:07:12,240
species killing other species it's also full 
of species not killing other species 75 of the  

1475
03:07:12,240 --> 03:07:17,120
animals on this planet are herbivores of course 
but why do we try to justify human behavior based  

1476
03:07:17,120 --> 03:07:21,840
on lion behavior or shark behavior it's also 
unfair because nobody else wants to do anything  

1477
03:07:21,840 --> 03:07:26,160
else that lions do you notice that convenient 
argument we just want to do what the lions do  

1478
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:31,840
when they eat antelope no the argument is it 
might be quite natural to kill animals maybe you  

1479
03:07:31,840 --> 03:07:38,400
should do it in the most humane way possible 
and exaggerate what like a humane holocaust  

1480
03:07:39,520 --> 03:07:43,920
we can't throw this word humane out there when 
we're talking about rape torture and murder  

1481
03:07:43,920 --> 03:07:49,279
you can't put the word humane next to it doesn't 
work like that that's not how the world works  

1482
03:07:49,279 --> 03:07:56,399
like if let's let's take for example some farmer 
far away maybe far away in time in the past  

1483
03:07:56,399 --> 03:08:04,319
grows an animal and the animal has a 
wonderful life grazing and enjoying itself  

1484
03:08:04,319 --> 03:08:10,319
and when the time crime comes he kills it the 
animal in in the in a you know you know in a  

1485
03:08:10,319 --> 03:08:16,160
nice way is the nicest possible this is not rape 
this is not holocaust this is the way of life  

1486
03:08:16,160 --> 03:08:24,160
okay so if i go and meet a woman at a bar i 
buy her some drinks i bring her some flowers  

1487
03:08:24,160 --> 03:08:30,559
i take her back and put on some soft music 
some teddy pendergrass and we dance and we  

1488
03:08:30,560 --> 03:08:36,000
look in each other's eyes and i slippery 
date rape drug and rape her is that humane  

1489
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:44,080
why not she didn't feel a thing see because the 
act of rape is evil okay the act of murder is evil  

1490
03:08:44,080 --> 03:08:48,720
you can't do it in a nice way okay we have 
to stop thinking that there's a nice we  

1491
03:08:48,720 --> 03:08:55,840
in fact you know what the nice way to kill is 
not to kill that's a nice way is it working  

1492
03:08:55,840 --> 03:09:01,920
do you think do you think that the world is 
progressing um in the direction you wanted to pre  

1493
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:08,240
to progress in a pace that's efficient 
not quickly enough for the victims but  

1494
03:09:08,880 --> 03:09:17,200
sadly as you know change is slow it took 400 years 
to convince white people in america not to own  

1495
03:09:17,200 --> 03:09:23,760
blacks you can see why this is taking so long we 
can't even treat each other kindly you can see  

1496
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:30,319
why we have a difficult time treating chickens and 
pigs and cows and mice and insects with kindness  

1497
03:09:30,319 --> 03:09:36,319
but as i bring this up i want to let people know 
that the the path to peace is through veganism  

1498
03:09:37,200 --> 03:09:43,359
it is by we could we can find peace on this 
planet by eradicating speciesism because  

1499
03:09:43,359 --> 03:09:49,439
this is the first form of hatred humans are taught 
racism sexism anti-semitism heterosexism these are  

1500
03:09:49,439 --> 03:09:55,839
branches of hatred the root is speciesism because 
that's the first form of hatred humans are taught  

1501
03:09:55,840 --> 03:09:59,520
when you're a kid growing up you're taught 
hey be nice to the dog be nice to the cat  

1502
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:04,160
but that cow that chicken yeah he doesn't count 
just kill them screw them uh be nice to the horse  

1503
03:10:04,160 --> 03:10:09,760
uh be upset when somebody poaches a rhino uh be 
upset if somebody cuts the fins off of a shark  

1504
03:10:09,760 --> 03:10:16,800
hey but that uh turkey kill em thanksgiving it's a 
holiday so the kid is confused growing up so when  

1505
03:10:16,800 --> 03:10:21,200
we get down to talking about discrimination and 
why it's wrong where it comes from it all stems  

1506
03:10:21,200 --> 03:10:26,639
from that somebody looks and acts differently 
than you if you taught a child growing up that hey  

1507
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:32,080
just because that chicken looks differently than 
you do that chicken has every right to live that  

1508
03:10:32,080 --> 03:10:37,040
spider has every right to live just like you do 
how is that child going to grow up and look at a  

1509
03:10:37,040 --> 03:10:42,160
different person who's a different size shape and 
color how is that kid going to look at that person  

1510
03:10:42,160 --> 03:10:48,639
in hatred with violence speciesism by eradicating 
that we can bring peace to this planet i want  

1511
03:10:48,640 --> 03:10:54,161
to ask you gary but you're concentrating 
on the moral argument might be that the  

1512
03:10:54,960 --> 03:11:03,520
health or medical argument in not eating meat 
may be more effective or the ecological argument  

1513
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:09,520
of the meat industry spoiling this planet 
might be more effective but you make it a  

1514
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:17,520
point to concentrate on the moral argument almost 
solely why because we claim to be moral beings  

1515
03:11:17,520 --> 03:11:21,600
we claim to know right from wrong we 
claim to be compassionate and as long  

1516
03:11:21,600 --> 03:11:27,200
as humans make these claims i'm going to be in 
everyone's face and say you can't do it halfway  

1517
03:11:27,200 --> 03:11:33,439
you can't pick and choose who to be kind to and 
when to be kind you're kind across the board or  

1518
03:11:33,439 --> 03:11:40,319
you're not and i'm confused as to why we always 
have to go back to the table of justice and beg  

1519
03:11:40,319 --> 03:11:47,200
the majority of people to stop harming and killing 
somebody else we do this over and over again can  

1520
03:11:47,200 --> 03:11:52,479
we just cut to the chase and say that everyone 
on this planet deserves fair and equal treatment  

1521
03:11:53,359 --> 03:11:58,319
people who eat meat cheese milk and eggs are on 
the wrong side of justice people who don't support  

1522
03:11:58,319 --> 03:12:04,559
animal rights will not win this battle injustice 
cannot live forever it never it lasts a long time  

1523
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:10,081
unfortunately for the victims but injustice 
cannot live forever but if someone were to  

1524
03:12:10,720 --> 03:12:20,720
to to convince you that the ecological argument or 
the health the medical argument may be much more  

1525
03:12:20,720 --> 03:12:27,600
effective why don't use it because the issue is 
going to be ethics to me health issues are selfish  

1526
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:32,399
reasons i'm trying to make people unselfish the 
reason why we're so mean animals because we think  

1527
03:12:32,399 --> 03:12:36,799
we're so special that's selfish i'm trying 
to make people unselfish i'm trying to make  

1528
03:12:36,800 --> 03:12:43,920
people be altruistic as a boy back in michigan 
in the states of a nice jewish family right  

1529
03:12:45,600 --> 03:12:51,439
was it something that could have told me 
that uh as a grown-up you'll be doing the  

1530
03:12:51,439 --> 03:12:55,599
things that you do not a chance not a chance 
there's no this is what's so bizarre about this  

1531
03:12:57,439 --> 03:13:02,160
the meat eating temperament wise oh 
well i always had an authority problem  

1532
03:13:03,040 --> 03:13:07,920
surprise yeah i i always liked to buck 
the system i was always kind of a rebel i  

1533
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:13,680
didn't like rules especially when the rules were 
silly or unjust or they didn't make any sense so  

1534
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:19,040
were you one of these youths to get in trouble oh 
every day at high school i was in the principal's  

1535
03:13:19,040 --> 03:13:25,359
office every single day absolutely i'm not a funny 
story too i was i was such a troublemaker too in  

1536
03:13:25,359 --> 03:13:30,559
our high school growing up we had to sign up 
for our classes but we were told over the four  

1537
03:13:30,560 --> 03:13:34,960
years you have to make sure you do this amount 
of math this amount of english well i despise  

1538
03:13:34,960 --> 03:13:40,399
math so i never signed up for any math classes 
i took extra english classes i'm a speaker i was  

1539
03:13:40,399 --> 03:13:46,239
always fascinated with words so two weeks before 
graduation miss jackson called me in and said gary  

1540
03:13:46,960 --> 03:13:51,200
i was going over your your record you haven't 
signed up for any math classes in four years  

1541
03:13:51,200 --> 03:13:56,239
i can't let you graduate and i said you want to 
keep me here for another year that's fine with me  

1542
03:13:56,960 --> 03:14:00,160
no mind you i'm the troublemaker in the office 
every day and she looks at me up and down  

1543
03:14:01,680 --> 03:14:06,319
just get out of here side to side go get out of 
here only i can get away with something like that  

1544
03:14:06,319 --> 03:14:10,719
so and then eventually you find yourself 
in jail as well yeah well you know after  

1545
03:14:10,720 --> 03:14:16,000
when i first found out about the animal issues i 
of course looked up other revolutions in history  

1546
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:20,960
i saw what gandhi did that he was going to jail 
and getting arrested i saw martin luther king and  

1547
03:14:20,960 --> 03:14:26,479
rosa parks and cesar chavez they were all getting 
arrested for their cause doing civil disobedience  

1548
03:14:26,479 --> 03:14:32,080
so i thought that was the path uh to help animals 
become liberated so that's what i went out and did  

1549
03:14:32,080 --> 03:14:38,800
too did you did you freeze some animals i freed 
1542 mink from an animal concentration camp  

1550
03:14:40,479 --> 03:14:45,279
that was one of the jail that was the first 
major one that put me on the map uh things went  

1551
03:14:45,279 --> 03:14:50,719
badly for me that night 540 mink did escape and 
they were never going to be tortured again they  

1552
03:14:50,720 --> 03:14:56,800
may have their necks broken by the way manually 
on a fur farm uh i was apprehended that evening it  

1553
03:14:56,800 --> 03:15:02,080
was easter sunday 1997 when i did this i thought 
that was a good day to go help somebody out  

1554
03:15:02,080 --> 03:15:08,080
uh i was charged with b e and i was sentenced to 
six months in a maximum security detention center  

1555
03:15:08,080 --> 03:15:12,640
and even those prisoners knew that it was crazy 
that i was there because when they started asking  

1556
03:15:12,640 --> 03:15:16,399
questions they saw me on the news and they said 
what are you doing here with us you freed some  

1557
03:15:16,399 --> 03:15:23,679
rats and you're here with us i said no no i also 
caused 2.1 million dollars in damage that night  

1558
03:15:23,680 --> 03:15:27,920
and put the put the make murder out of 
business permanently and we don't tolerate  

1559
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:34,239
economic sabotage in our society because we 
don't worship god i saw a stat that 96 of the  

1560
03:15:34,239 --> 03:15:38,719
population believes in god i don't deny that 
i just wish they worshiped god because people  

1561
03:15:38,720 --> 03:15:43,600
worship the root of all evil people worship money 
and that's why all this violence takes place too

1562
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:50,479
it is the most profitable business on this planet 
since the beginning of time animal slavery nothing  

1563
03:15:50,479 --> 03:15:56,879
comes close not cars not gasoline not oil not 
computers nothing compares to the amount of money  

1564
03:15:56,880 --> 03:16:02,560
being made off the backs of animals literally do 
you believe in god yes i do absolutely we'll talk  

1565
03:16:02,560 --> 03:16:06,320
openly about god i don't believe in organized 
religion but i absolutely believe in god  

1566
03:16:07,840 --> 03:16:11,920
i believe in the garden of vegan oops the 
garden of eden i believe and thou shall not  

1567
03:16:11,920 --> 03:16:17,200
kill i believe genesis 1 29 god's first law 
is i give you seed bearing plants for food i  

1568
03:16:17,200 --> 03:16:23,519
believe that god created humans animals and the 
earth therefore god is inside humans animals and  

1569
03:16:23,520 --> 03:16:30,319
the earth therefore if you murder humans animals 
and the earth you are murdering god i notice that  

1570
03:16:30,319 --> 03:16:37,200
religious people love to worship things that 
we created in god's name the bible the koran  

1571
03:16:38,399 --> 03:16:44,160
stars of david and the cross but nobody worships 
anything that god created animals kill them  

1572
03:16:44,160 --> 03:16:47,920
kill them right now those horns and that 
cow cut them off right now while that  

1573
03:16:47,920 --> 03:16:52,319
cow was fully conscious that's the 
water pollute it the air pollute it  

1574
03:16:52,319 --> 03:16:58,000
every the force cut it down anything that god 
made we destroy anything that we made in god's  

1575
03:16:58,000 --> 03:17:03,840
name we worship so my condemnation isn't 
about god it's about what religious people do  

1576
03:17:03,840 --> 03:17:11,840
in god's name well i'm very glad you came to our 
studio thank you for coming thanks for having me  

1577
03:17:15,120 --> 03:17:20,000
do you think it's really necessary is it do 
you really believe it's the same i think it's  

1578
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:24,960
killing people and killing animals yeah i think 
it's worse when we talk about the holocaust we  

1579
03:17:24,960 --> 03:17:30,239
have six million jews you can add the other six 
million blacks gypsies mentally [ __ ] people in  

1580
03:17:30,239 --> 03:17:38,399
america today 30 million innocent beings will be 
murdered for a sandwich every year on this planet  

1581
03:17:38,399 --> 03:17:45,279
60 billion land animals and 90 billion marine 
animals are killed that's a holocaust of mine  

1582
03:17:46,640 --> 03:17:52,560
these are cows and we're talking about people 
but that's what the nazis said these are jews  

1583
03:17:52,560 --> 03:17:57,360
they don't count i'm a nazi and i count and so you 
really don't see a difference between animals and  

1584
03:17:57,920 --> 03:18:02,560
people absolutely not especially when it comes to 
pain and suffering we all suffer in the same way  

1585
03:18:03,120 --> 03:18:06,559
we all feel pain in the same 
way a knife in my throat  

1586
03:18:06,560 --> 03:18:11,920
is just as painful and harmful as a knife 
and a cow's throat in a chicken's throat  

1587
03:18:11,920 --> 03:18:15,920
and the jew don't you get a strong reaction 
for using the that comparison it's usually  

1588
03:18:15,920 --> 03:18:20,880
positive i'm having nothing but success here 
remember i don't do things to be a politician  

1589
03:18:20,880 --> 03:18:26,239
i don't say things that people want me to 
say i speak the truth and the truth is harsh  

1590
03:18:26,239 --> 03:18:30,960
i know people don't want to hear that there's a 
holocaust taking place that they're taking part in  

1591
03:18:30,960 --> 03:18:38,560
but that's a fact i'm not being dramatic again if 
you go back 60 70 years jewish women had babies in  

1592
03:18:38,560 --> 03:18:44,960
their arms and the nazis ripped those babies away 
in the dairy industry every cow not only has her  

1593
03:18:44,960 --> 03:18:51,359
baby stolen she's raped to impregnate her and then 
when the baby is born they steal the baby away  

1594
03:18:51,359 --> 03:18:59,359
they tattoo jews we tattoo animals we brand them 
as you see it we are all nothing to you well  

1595
03:18:59,359 --> 03:19:04,799
not to me you have to think about the victims 
the victims think you're a nazi remember isaac  

1596
03:19:04,800 --> 03:19:11,359
bashevis singer great jewish humanitarian who 
was vegan he's the one that said in relation to  

1597
03:19:11,359 --> 03:19:18,559
animals all humans are nazis for the animals it 
is an eternal treblinka so it's not so important  

1598
03:19:18,560 --> 03:19:23,760
what i think it's what the animals are thinking 
we're now seeing uh currently seeing uh uh short  

1599
03:19:24,720 --> 03:19:29,360
uh that's shocking shocking it's 
it's cruel and it's disgusting and uh  

1600
03:19:30,479 --> 03:19:36,319
you want to prove what i want to show people 
what's going on because if you watch the news  

1601
03:19:36,880 --> 03:19:44,239
if you watch tv the advertisements are happy cows 
right if they're never showing you slaughterhouses  

1602
03:19:44,239 --> 03:19:49,359
think about this if a slaughterhouse wasn't such 
an evil place how come mcdonald's and burger  

1603
03:19:49,359 --> 03:19:53,359
ranch why don't they show you slaughterhouses 
and say hey this is where your hamburger comes  

1604
03:19:53,359 --> 03:19:59,120
from this is where your chicken nuggets come 
from they intentionally lie to you i don't lie  

1605
03:19:59,120 --> 03:20:04,080
i intentionally tell you the truth because i think 
if you saw what was going on in the slaughterhouse  

1606
03:20:04,080 --> 03:20:09,120
no logical person could choose to continue 
to eat animal flesh and the things that come  

1607
03:20:09,120 --> 03:20:15,279
out of animals so what is your final goal 
to to kill the meat industry to kill the  

1608
03:20:16,720 --> 03:20:22,880
farms i want to destroy all animal exploitative 
industries they're unjust the animals are not  

1609
03:20:22,880 --> 03:20:27,840
willing participants in this holocaust what about 
the people that take place in those uh industries  

1610
03:20:28,479 --> 03:20:36,239
i read this somewhere that you said that uh a 
man that hurts an animal uh uh you could kill  

1611
03:20:36,239 --> 03:20:42,559
him or should die or something like that there's 
a justification for killing anybody who harms  

1612
03:20:42,560 --> 03:20:49,359
a human or an animal intentionally again you have 
to understand nobody's opposed to violence and  

1613
03:20:49,359 --> 03:20:54,799
i've been asking the audience here every day raise 
your hand if you're opposed to the allied forces  

1614
03:20:55,359 --> 03:21:02,000
coming into auschwitz and birkenau and murdering 
nazis to save jews and nobody raises their hands  

1615
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:07,120
the problem is nobody thinks animals are 
important enough to kill for i think the  

1616
03:21:07,120 --> 03:21:12,000
animals disagree i think the cows and the chickens 
disagree so if i went into a slaughterhouse i'm  

1617
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:16,960
the peaceful person if i even if i had guns 
drawn i don't know what's not about operator  

1618
03:21:16,960 --> 03:21:22,640
i would say drop your weapons you're done killing 
you're going to let these cows and these pigs and  

1619
03:21:22,640 --> 03:21:28,319
these chickens go i'm the one that's justified i'm 
stopping murder there's a justification there's  

1620
03:21:28,319 --> 03:21:34,880
nobility in killing somebody who has no the allied 
forces were noble do you think they weren't noble  

1621
03:21:35,600 --> 03:21:39,439
do you think that they should have let nazis 
kill jesus they did what they should have done  

1622
03:21:39,439 --> 03:21:43,759
and that's what we need to do as human beings if 
we claim to be compassionate claim to know right  

1623
03:21:43,760 --> 03:21:49,840
from wrong we have to kill beings who kill evil 
people but with that saying you give legitimacy to  

1624
03:21:49,840 --> 03:21:56,160
people who murder other people you know every each 
um every person could choose his own goal like uh  

1625
03:21:56,160 --> 03:22:01,359
the person who killed our prime minister igalami 
he said okay i did it to save the country to save  

1626
03:22:01,359 --> 03:22:06,319
more people getting killed but you know why that 
was unjust who was he killing the prime minister  

1627
03:22:06,319 --> 03:22:11,279
no who was the prime minister killing nobody you 
understand the difference between a murder for no  

1628
03:22:11,279 --> 03:22:16,800
reason a psychotic murder a psychotic murder that 
a fundamentalist jew a fundamentalist christian  

1629
03:22:16,800 --> 03:22:22,640
the fundamentalist muslim takes part in and going 
into a slaughterhouse and saying leave these cows  

1630
03:22:22,640 --> 03:22:30,800
alone nobody chickens have harmed nobody we are 
murdering innocent beings so if it ever came down  

1631
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:35,840
to that but that's not the issue that is not the 
issue the issue is we just need to change the way  

1632
03:22:35,840 --> 03:22:40,720
we view animals we have to realize humans aren't 
the only beings on this planet and we're not  

1633
03:22:40,720 --> 03:22:45,439
more important than animals so why are aren't 
you allowed in some countries you can't enter  

1634
03:22:45,439 --> 03:22:51,679
canada uh or the uk i think because we live on 
a planet that murders animals a speciesistic  

1635
03:22:51,680 --> 03:22:57,520
plant and understand like a racist who thinks that 
their race is better than another race speciesists  

1636
03:22:57,520 --> 03:23:02,319
think that the human species is superior to 
animals and we have the right to harm and kill  

1637
03:23:02,319 --> 03:23:07,920
any species we choose so why would countries 
who murder animals want me to come in there  

1638
03:23:07,920 --> 03:23:12,160
and open people's eyes and get people to change 
were you surprised from your success in israel  

1639
03:23:13,760 --> 03:23:18,880
i've always noticed that over the years if 
i talk to people who have been oppressed  

1640
03:23:18,880 --> 03:23:23,520
if i do a classroom full of jewish 
people if i do a classroom full of women  

1641
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:30,319
full of hispanics black people people who have 
been oppressed understand oppression so i'm  

1642
03:23:30,319 --> 03:23:36,080
not surprised that israel is embracing veganism 
right now and embracing me we've been oppressed  

1643
03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:41,120
way back into egypt times and to this day still 
depending on what part of the world you're in  

1644
03:23:41,120 --> 03:23:46,880
so people who have been harmed understand why 
it's wrong to harm somebody else so you really  

1645
03:23:46,880 --> 03:23:51,840
think you have a chance i think there's a chance 
i mean it kind of depends on which day you ask me  

1646
03:23:51,840 --> 03:23:56,239
you ask me when i'm in israel for the last 10 
days and people are embracing me i think yeah  

1647
03:23:56,239 --> 03:24:01,599
i think israel could become the first nation 
on this planet to abolish concentration camps  

1648
03:24:01,600 --> 03:24:06,239
once and for all you ask me on a bad day when 
people are screaming and yelling at me wanting  

1649
03:24:06,239 --> 03:24:11,840
to fight i'll say no i don't think it's possible 
but keep in mind no injustice can live forever  

1650
03:24:12,399 --> 03:24:18,319
sadly injustice can live for hundreds or 
even thousands of years but no lie can last  

1651
03:24:18,319 --> 03:24:23,040
forever and people are becoming aware and i 
think animals will obtain their freedom one  

1652
03:24:23,040 --> 03:24:28,000
day and be treated equally and fairly well

is one on one joining me tonight is animal 
liberation activist gary yourofsky who has  

1658
03:25:23,359 --> 03:25:29,679
made a name for himself by becoming something of 
a controversial figure in animal in the animal  

1659
03:25:29,680 --> 03:25:35,359
rights arena apart from giving lectures mr 
yarovsky is best known for his approaches  

1660
03:25:35,359 --> 03:25:42,639
in which to get his point across such as 
breaking into a fur farm in liberation 1500  

1661
03:25:42,640 --> 03:25:49,600
soon to be murdered minx for reasons such as this 
mr yurovsky has been arrested numerous of times  

1662
03:25:49,600 --> 03:25:56,239
and has been banned from entering the united 
kingdom and canada while mr yarovsky means of  

1663
03:25:56,239 --> 03:26:02,719
putting an end to what he calls an animal 
holocaust his message has reached millions of  

1664
03:26:02,720 --> 03:26:09,439
people all around the world and has influenced 
many in changing their perspective of the food  

1665
03:26:09,439 --> 03:26:15,679
industry good evening and thank you very much for 
coming to our studio thanks for having me so um  

1666
03:26:16,479 --> 03:26:21,359
i will start like we said you affected millions 
and millions of people around the world  

1667
03:26:22,640 --> 03:26:28,240
why is it so effective here in israel 
how come that it's catching in israel  

1668
03:26:29,520 --> 03:26:33,201
i'm not clearly sure why but 
the only thing that i can  

1669
03:26:33,920 --> 03:26:40,080
figure out is that over the years as i've talked 
to tens of thousands of people i've noticed that  

1670
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:48,000
people who have been oppressed jews hispanics 
women blacks they always respond better to  

1671
03:26:48,720 --> 03:26:52,479
this revolution that i'm involved in because 
they understand oppression they've been through  

1672
03:26:52,479 --> 03:26:55,919
it they know what it's like to be treated 
like nothing like their lives don't matter  

1673
03:26:56,560 --> 03:27:01,200
so that's what i think is going on here jews 
have been an oppressed people for thousands of  

1674
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:07,279
years we understand oppression and we're supposed 
to not support it so i'm just pointing this out  

1675
03:27:07,279 --> 03:27:12,559
to everybody because people don't realize how much 
they're harming animals in their daily lives so as  

1676
03:27:12,560 --> 03:27:18,479
i point out the steak the hamburger the chicken 
sandwich that you're eating the schnitzel okay  

1677
03:27:18,479 --> 03:27:24,639
these these pieces of meat came off the bodies of 
living animals who didn't want to be murdered who  

1678
03:27:24,640 --> 03:27:30,239
didn't want to suffer and die who didn't want 
to be tormented so once i pointed out to people  

1679
03:27:30,239 --> 03:27:36,719
most people same people logical people make that 
next step to veganism we like to use euphemisms  

1680
03:27:36,720 --> 03:27:42,319
which is why these atrocities take place so we 
always want to say leather when it's cow skin  

1681
03:27:42,319 --> 03:27:49,279
and we want to say even even the term bacon 
what's bacon you mean pig flesh so once you  

1682
03:27:49,279 --> 03:27:54,479
start thinking about what we're wearing and what 
we're eating again this is why i say sane people  

1683
03:27:54,479 --> 03:27:59,919
will make a choice towards veganism it makes no 
sense because if you let's put it this way i like  

1684
03:27:59,920 --> 03:28:04,800
to explain how this is the biggest holocaust that 
has ever existed people get upset at those terms  

1685
03:28:04,800 --> 03:28:09,439
i have to tell you that i am upset about 
hearing like holocaust comparing the holocaust  

1686
03:28:09,439 --> 03:28:16,319
to like every single person that that heard your 
lectures and to hear this holocaust comparing it  

1687
03:28:16,319 --> 03:28:23,040
to animals it's a little bit limited and you know 
what and i'm not even jewish okay but it's hurts  

1688
03:28:23,040 --> 03:28:28,640
me well let me explain how how this this holocaust 
is actually worse i'm offended that we compare  

1689
03:28:28,640 --> 03:28:33,120
human holocaust to the animal holocaust which is 
the biggest holocaust in the history of humankind  

1690
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:38,800
if you went to the nearest cow or chicken 
slaughterhouse and remove the animals  

1691
03:28:38,800 --> 03:28:43,920
and replace them with jews you have now 
recreated auschwitz there's no difference  

1692
03:28:43,920 --> 03:28:50,800
you have a building that exists to dismantle to 
torment to torture and murder innocent beings  

1693
03:28:50,800 --> 03:28:56,720
let's play a time game war a time warp game ghosts 
go back 60 70 years you go back to auschwitz or  

1694
03:28:56,720 --> 03:29:00,800
you go back to birkenau you remove the jews 
and replace them with cows and chickens  

1695
03:29:01,520 --> 03:29:06,240
you still have a holocaust taking place 
this in fact we learn how to kill jews  

1696
03:29:07,040 --> 03:29:11,200
in the hall like the nazis did because they 
studied what the meat industry was doing  

1697
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:15,599
we've learned how to torture and kill each 
other because we practiced on the animals first  

1698
03:29:15,600 --> 03:29:22,480
but animals are eating animals some animals 
75 of animals on this planet are herbivores  

1699
03:29:23,120 --> 03:29:28,479
but the it's it's part of our circle of life now 
this is the circle of torture and death when you  

1700
03:29:28,479 --> 03:29:34,639
see uh a lion eating a zebra it's it's blue and 
you're but i noticed you have clothes on and i  

1701
03:29:34,640 --> 03:29:39,520
noticed that you have a cell phone and you have a 
computer it is unfair to pick one thing that lions  

1702
03:29:39,520 --> 03:29:43,840
do that you want to mimic when you don't want 
to mimic anything else they do when lions walk  

1703
03:29:43,840 --> 03:29:48,160
up and greet each other they sniff each other's 
ass when i came in this room you did not kneel  

1704
03:29:48,160 --> 03:29:55,200
down and sniff my ass okay lions sometimes kill 
their young when their runts okay if a human being  

1705
03:29:55,200 --> 03:29:59,279
killed their baby because they didn't want him we 
arrest them and charge them with murder could you  

1706
03:29:59,279 --> 03:30:05,759
go to a courtroom and say hey but your honor lions 
kill their babies can't i it's a survivor it's  

1707
03:30:05,760 --> 03:30:11,279
an unfair comparison you're not a lion and just 
so you know lions are carnivores humans are not  

1708
03:30:11,279 --> 03:30:16,160
we are herbivores one hundred percent up and 
down you put a two-year-old child in a crib  

1709
03:30:16,160 --> 03:30:21,120
with a bunny rabbit and an apple let me know 
when the child eats the bunny rabbit and plays  

1710
03:30:21,120 --> 03:30:26,559
with the apple we are purely herbivorous we have 
no carnivorous or omnivorous instincts whatsoever  

1711
03:30:26,560 --> 03:30:31,760
and physiologically if your jaw moves from side 
to side in a grinding motion and you chew you're  

1712
03:30:31,760 --> 03:30:36,479
100 herbivore if you were a meat-eater like a lion 
your jaw would only go like this up and down rip  

1713
03:30:36,479 --> 03:30:41,759
and swallow if you sweat through your pores to 
cool yourself your herbivore what is your main  

1714
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:48,479
purpose because most of the world won't become 
vegan it depends on which day you ask me the world  

1715
03:30:48,479 --> 03:30:54,399
injustice can't live forever the world will become 
vegan one day just like just like every woman on  

1716
03:30:54,399 --> 03:31:01,040
this planet will one day have their equality with 
men just like one day all oppression will fall  

1717
03:31:01,040 --> 03:31:06,319
by the wayside injustice doesn't live forever and 
it seems insurmountable don't get me wrong i mean  

1718
03:31:06,319 --> 03:31:11,679
i'm in the trenches believe me it looks like it 
seems like it can't happen but remember it took  

1719
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:19,040
400 years to convince white people in america 
not to own black people you can see why this is  

1720
03:31:19,040 --> 03:31:23,760
taking so long we can't even treat each other 
with kindness let alone treat the chickens and  

1721
03:31:23,760 --> 03:31:28,960
the pigs and the turkeys and the insects of the 
world with kindness but i think we can treat each  

1722
03:31:28,960 --> 03:31:33,760
other with kindness one day once we learn how 
to treat the animals with kindness you know i'm  

1723
03:31:34,399 --> 03:31:40,559
i'm i'm feeling a little bit uncomfortable 
because i just had a steak for lunch and um  

1724
03:31:41,520 --> 03:31:49,359
i and it's still i'm not convinced convinced 100 
that i should stop eating meat for the rest of my  

1725
03:31:49,359 --> 03:31:56,960
life it's not that i'm eating meat every day but 
i do love my steak on the plate once a week so  

1726
03:31:56,960 --> 03:32:05,920
you have now two minutes to try to convince me eat 
meat once in once a month i don't want to convince  

1727
03:32:05,920 --> 03:32:11,120
you to do it once a month i want to convince you 
never to do it okay you have to put yourself in  

1728
03:32:11,120 --> 03:32:21,279
the animal's position imagine that you were raped 
to impregnate yourself okay somebody raped you to  

1729
03:32:21,279 --> 03:32:27,519
impregnate you you gave birth to this baby this 
baby was stolen from you at birth that baby was  

1730
03:32:27,520 --> 03:32:33,920
fattened up with corn and soy and wheat and oats 
that baby was put on a concentration camp truck  

1731
03:32:33,920 --> 03:32:40,319
sent to a slaughterhouse hung upside down fully 
conscious in front of all of her own species  

1732
03:32:41,520 --> 03:32:49,439
screaming terrified in fear knife shoved into you 
know her throat cut up into pieces where's the  

1733
03:32:49,439 --> 03:32:54,639
justification for this and it's not your steak you 
said my steak i'm very big on language that steak  

1734
03:32:54,640 --> 03:33:00,080
was never yours okay that steak is a euphemism 
by the way that's cow flesh that flesh belonged  

1735
03:33:00,080 --> 03:33:06,640
to another living being where do humans get off 
owning and controlling living beings where do  

1736
03:33:06,640 --> 03:33:10,960
we get off thinking that we're the most special 
thing that has ever existed on this planet when  

1737
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:17,680
in reality we're the most unspecial thing that has 
ever existed on this planet are you aware that if  

1738
03:33:17,680 --> 03:33:22,720
humans were removed from the planet the extinction 
of humans would benefit everything that exists  

1739
03:33:23,279 --> 03:33:28,160
are you also aware that if the bees died off 
as we've been talking about this for about 10  

1740
03:33:28,160 --> 03:33:34,800
years in the news the whole system collapses 
if the ants were exterminated the whole system  

1741
03:33:34,800 --> 03:33:39,040
would collapse this is how important and 
special ants and bees are to the world  

1742
03:33:39,760 --> 03:33:46,479
why do we think we're better than they are 
when they serve a vital role and we serve no  

1743
03:33:46,479 --> 03:33:51,040
vital role whatsoever we're tormentors we're 
oppressors where do you think it's come it's  

1744
03:33:51,040 --> 03:33:56,239
coming from the arrogance yeah i'm not sure i 
don't know i don't know what has gotten into us  

1745
03:33:56,800 --> 03:34:01,120
besides death and torture and murder i think 
when you put violence in you get violence out  

1746
03:34:01,120 --> 03:34:06,479
you consume discrimination and death you're 
going to you know exude some people may say the  

1747
03:34:06,479 --> 03:34:12,080
same things about you because some people may say 
that he's arrogance he thinks that he knows better  

1748
03:34:12,080 --> 03:34:18,960
he thinks that he's better than us and actually 
we're all actually um we're all let's say  

1749
03:34:20,399 --> 03:34:26,719
how can i put it i'm i'm the one to be charged and 
you are the the judge who is judging me right now  

1750
03:34:26,720 --> 03:34:29,920
yeah and well there's two people in this world 
there's there's people that judge and people  

1751
03:34:29,920 --> 03:34:34,399
that lie about judging we judge people every 
day we judge child molesters we judge rapists  

1752
03:34:34,399 --> 03:34:39,839
we judge nazis uh we judge murderers um and i 
know this is a shock to the meat dairy and egg  

1753
03:34:39,840 --> 03:34:46,560
eaters of the world but vegans are more ethical 
than they are hands down and of course just like  

1754
03:34:46,560 --> 03:34:52,000
a person that doesn't rape is more ethical than 
a person who does rape a person who doesn't kill  

1755
03:34:52,000 --> 03:34:56,960
cows pigs chickens and turkeys is better than 
a person who does a vegetarian hitler was not a  

1756
03:34:56,960 --> 03:35:01,840
vegetarian that's a complete lie a complete and 
utter lie from gerbils his propaganda minister  

1757
03:35:01,840 --> 03:35:06,399
hitler did have a lot of power didn't he if he had 
all this power that he had why didn't he mandate  

1758
03:35:06,399 --> 03:35:11,679
veganism if he were a vegan or a vegetarian do you 
know that himmler the guy that constructed all the  

1759
03:35:11,680 --> 03:35:17,040
gas chambers was a chicken he wanted to slaughter 
jews this is why he had another idea a complete  

1760
03:35:17,040 --> 03:35:22,720
other idea two of his biographers albert spear 
and robert payne talked about hitler's love for  

1761
03:35:22,720 --> 03:35:29,520
liver dumplings and pigeon which is known as squab 
his main chef dion lucas wrote a book in 1964 the  

1762
03:35:29,520 --> 03:35:34,960
gourmet school cooking book and she wrote his 
favorite recipes which were all meat based recipes  

1763
03:35:34,960 --> 03:35:39,200
this is the power of propaganda the 
power of gerbils still alive and well  

1764
03:35:39,200 --> 03:35:44,160
do you know why people think hitler was veg 
gerbils wanted to make hitler seem as peaceful  

1765
03:35:44,160 --> 03:35:49,920
as somebody else in the world at that time who was 
loved and adored and his name was mohandas gandhi  

1766
03:35:49,920 --> 03:35:55,120
and gandhi was vegetarian and gerbils will say 
wait hitler's just like gandhi he loves animals  

1767
03:35:55,120 --> 03:36:00,000
too and he's peaceful to the animals and he's a 
vegetarian he's not and just so you know all the  

1768
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:06,399
concentration camps did have animal slaughter 
houses there too and when the allied forces  

1769
03:36:06,399 --> 03:36:11,920
came in to rescue the jews and the gypsies they 
left the animals behind this is why i call this  

1770
03:36:11,920 --> 03:36:16,880
the world's largest and longest-running holocaust 
the animal holocaust was happening long before the  

1771
03:36:16,880 --> 03:36:22,720
jewish holocaust during the jewish holocaust and 
it's still happening today every second just so  

1772
03:36:22,720 --> 03:36:28,960
you know of every minute of every hour of every 
day female animals are raped to impregnate them  

1773
03:36:28,960 --> 03:36:35,359
every second animals are being killed every 
60 billion animals every year do you accept  

1774
03:36:35,359 --> 03:36:40,479
or do you understand or the people are calling 
you terrorists sure what else are they going to  

1775
03:36:40,479 --> 03:36:46,399
call me and as we go back in time and look at all 
the other people that we adore now collectively  

1776
03:36:46,399 --> 03:36:52,719
we all agree gandhi and dr martin luther king
