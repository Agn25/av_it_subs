1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,720
all right we are live welcome all to this 
very special david rams live stream where  

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,360
we're going to be joined by paul and nassau from 
anonymous for the voiceless to discuss a load of  

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,680
different rumors accusations i laugh because some 
of them are pretty funny but no some of them are  

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,040
very serious rumors accusations and a whole load 
of questions that you've been sending to me um  

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,280
that you want to ask paula nasal the co-founders 
of anonymous for the voiceless we're going to  

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,360
go through all of these things but first of all i 
just want to do a bit of housekeeping with you so  

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,880
if you are watching this later 
as in you're not watching it live  

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,520
if you check across the bottom the progress bar 
you will see it's been split up into sections  

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,680
so if you want to find the specific question room 
or accusation or whatever that you're looking for  

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,880
you can find it right there if you have questions 
yourself right now and you are watching this live  

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,880
right now you have questions uh we're gonna do a q 
a at the end so save them for that but if you have  

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,640
a topic or a question that you really really want 
to be asked right now or or sooner you can use the  

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,240
super chat if you use a super chat i will pause 
and we'll answer your question right away but  

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,400
but there is a caveat there is a disclaimer here 
if you are spamming trolling or abusing anyone  

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,640
in any way including if you send a super chat and 
you pay for a super chat and it's a spam or abuse  

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,720
it won't be discussed so you'll be wasting your 
money i just want to make that very clear for you  

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,160
and that also goes for the live chat 
and it goes for the q a at the end  

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,360
we won't be tolerating any spam or any trolling or 
any abuse so the moderator will be handling that  

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,720
i hope it doesn't come to that but i know a lot 
of the topics that we're going to discuss are a  

20
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,760
little bit controversial so i expect that there 
will be at least one or two um so all that being  

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:00,720
said yeah just keep it sensible keep it polite 
and we'll have a a productive live stream that's  

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,400
pretty much it so with that being said let's 
bring in paul nasal welcome paul welcome myself  

23
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:18,160
hey what's up how you doing good how are you 
oh good all good all good i'm excited to get  

24
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,560
through this and i think a lot of people in the 
comments have been pretty pumped as well to uh  

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,000
you know get through this um i know for you too 
this is basically like you're repeating yourself  

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,320
a lot of these things because over the years 
i think i think we've been through this a few  

27
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,520
times or your own channels and in your own social 
medias but there are a few people at least a few  

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,920
people here that have been asking a few of the the 
questions already and a lot of people have been  

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,400
sending me questions so i'm happy we can we can 
do this and you know hopefully once and for all  

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,880
get everything discussed in one place so i really 
appreciate you coming on and doing this i know  

31
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:57,200
it's not the easiest thing to do um so we can 
kick off i suppose let's just kick straight in  

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
right i mean let's not waste any time we're 
here for a reason let's kick off with the  

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,840
recent there's the most recent stuff that's been 
going on right now i think most people watching  

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
are going to be here probably off the back of that 
i think i don't think we need to really introduce  

35
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,840
what av is and who you are i think anybody 
watching this is going to know that already  

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,280
so let's just jump in with the recent 
stuff and what's been going on with av with  

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,480
the the whole situation with joey the situation 
with animal safe movement anita the donor um  

38
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,800
where are we up to with this now could you give 
us an update on that just to kick things off

39
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,880
so we reached out to the donor 
to find out if this was a genuine

40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,480
um thing you know to legitimately 
continue donating to av  

41
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:03,040
and they replied with more demands on top 
of everything that was discussed in the  

42
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,520
videos we put out and everything that joey had 
mentioned so even more demands on top of that

43
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,920
that we had to respond to but we of course 
ourselves had things that we needed to communicate  

44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,200
to the donor i mean there's obviously a break 
in trust at this point and we need to have a  

45
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,120
conversation and re-establish that trust and 
things like this and we haven't heard back  

46
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:37,360
since we've replied so that was over almost 
a month ago now and we haven't heard back  

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,120
what were the extra requirements they were 
they were giving you like what did they add

48
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,440
one of them was for us to delete 
these videos that we put up  

49
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,840
about joey and that that was pretty 
telling of what this was really about

50
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,680
right right and what did they give her like 
any kind of justification for wanting that done  

51
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,320
or was it just a we request that you 
do this well it seemed like it was  

52
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:21,280
out of the uh concern for joey's image 
or his uh reputation yeah so so far to  

53
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,040
get it straight there the requirements so the 
requirements for the donor to continue funding av  

54
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,840
are that you delete those videos um give 
them uh of some i don't know financial  

55
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,320
organization access to all of your records 
um is the board of directors things still  

56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
going they still want you to do that as well is 
that still on the cards or did they pull that  

57
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,040
like well here's the thing you know there were 
things mentioned in the email that we got from  

58
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,840
the donor but we don't even know what exactly are 
the expectations on on their side and so that's  

59
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,760
why we wanted to have a conversation with them 
but at this point at this point we're not getting  

60
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:07,040
we're not getting that do you think it's possible 
that they did that to save a face as in they  

61
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,800
that joey was involved and gave that response 
to try to kind of yeah save face basically would  

62
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,520
that be that's fair to say or do you think that 
that he actually or she i don't know the donor  

63
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,920
didn't they actually want to rectify things or 
is it just to try to repair some of the damage  

64
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:29,360
to the reputation of joey and the donor i mean 
even in my most charitable of moods towards this

65
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,760
i can't see it any other way 
yeah it feels like that i mean  

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,280
from an outside perspective unfortunately it 
does feel like it was just an attempt to maybe uh  

67
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,760
i don't know get the upper hand take the high road 
you know or appear to be taking the high road but  

68
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,000
it's it's really sad to hear that actually 
it's you you actually took the decision to  

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,440
take the high road with them and then they just 
didn't respond which um yeah it's disappointing  

70
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:09,360
when we heard that there was this interest to 
continue funding us and have another conversation  

71
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:18,160
then we're like great let's have a conversation 
but then you know we're not going to be bored  

72
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,720
and bossed around and that's not what we designed 
a v for it's in fact the opposite of that  

73
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,840
and that's part of the reason 
why we're at this point  

74
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,160
that we're at and the reason why we 
have an organic following and you know  

75
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,160
it's i think there's just a misunderstanding 
of what we do from the donor's perspective  

76
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,520
and i think that they don't really understand 
that work and they don't really understand us  

77
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,760
and what our mission is and and they they perhaps 
got involved without doing their homework and  

78
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,320
we wanted to have a conversation so that we 
could get on the same page about things and  

79
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,480
we're not able to do that at this point so that's 
where everything is left at this point yeah  

80
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,080
i understand i understand and it's it's it's 
something that it's not a surprise that that  

81
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,640
the donor or anyone basically is having some 
kind of uh you know let's say strong opinion  

82
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,160
towards being like kind of anti-av this seems 
to be quite a common thing right now and i was  

83
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,880
just thinking about it earlier about what kind 
of an example could i give you know to uh like  

84
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,520
i don't know an analogy to give and um it's kind 
of funny i don't know if you'll agree with me but  

85
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,400
i feel like av has become kind of like 
the nickelback of animal rights it's like  

86
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,400
i'm sorry i'm sorry but nickelback 
are extremely successful

87
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,800
awards end this stream

88
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,720
nickelback has won loads of awards they play loads 
of gigs they're very successful they've got loads  

89
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:00,400
of fans but it's also very in to hate them it's 
almost like a trend to hate them right and that's  

90
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,800
what i'm kind of getting at here is that it's not 
a surprise to me that someone is holding really  

91
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,440
negative opinions without even considering what 
you're doing because that's the in thing to do  

92
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,840
that's the kind of point i was making it seems 
cool like when i put out some messages asking  

93
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,720
people hey you know give me some questions for 
av i had a few people just replying just just  

94
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,240
with some you know real virtue signaling stuff 
like just really like just explaining why they  

95
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,840
won't go for av anymore and i'm like that's great 
but like give me a question like give me something  

96
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,040
you know it just seems like it's cool to say i 
don't work with av i it seems cool to be like that  

97
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,600
like it's cool to say i hate nickelback i'm sorry 
to put you in that bracket but it really feels  

98
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,800
like that you know uh i've got to say and and that 
brings me on to go on go on sorry i think it's a  

99
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,880
lot cooler though yeah i mean come on chad kroger 
is not that that much of a loser is he come on  

100
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,840
no i used to listen to them when i was younger 
i have to admit i i i know it seems like it's uh  

101
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:11,680
it's a bandwagon for us to disagree with 
you on using that comparison but but it's uh

102
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:21,680
that's just a taste in music which i guess is 
i guess it's a taste in activism i guess you  

103
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,640
could that's the comparison you're making kind 
of yeah kind of but i think with nickelback  

104
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,880
um well anyway i don't want 
to get into the comparison

105
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
maybe it's for the best yeah um but i'm going 
to give an example actually because i i did have  

106
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
a plan set up for this stream but you know 
what i feel like this is relevant right now  

107
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,920
so i want to tell the viewers a quick story 
here about something that happened um i put  

108
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,000
these messages out didn't i put these posts 
out on my instagram asking people give me some  

109
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,760
give me some questions give me some topics i put 
it on facebook and by the way one of those posts  

110
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,960
is blown up with a load of nonsense but anyway 
that's another topic but some people responded  

111
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,360
to me saying you know certain things and i want 
to just bring up one of these responses that i had  

112
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,560
um from somebody on my instagram who who had a 
story to tell and i want to just kind of link  

113
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,520
it in with what we just said about it's cool to 
hate av it's cool to kind of just you know find  

114
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:25,840
something wrong and just almost even sometimes uh 
[ __ ] as well so i'm going to show you something  

115
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,400
that happened and this is real by the way i'm 
not this is not designed this wasn't planned this  

116
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,680
is something that genuinely happened and i've 
got the evidence because i can show you my um  

117
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,840
i can show you this the literal inbox from my 
instagram and you'll see why this is relevant  

118
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,720
in a moment so i'm going to show the screen so you 
can see it all right so here's my stories right i  

119
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,560
don't know if you can can you see that right now 
no how do i change those hold up i need to um  

120
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,800
add the different screen i've never added 
like a like uh this kind of screen i'm trying  

121
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:07,440
to get the uh preview screen up okay hold 
second all right open up um where are we

122
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,200
all right here we go so here's a story that uh i 
put my story out that night saying like tell me  

123
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,440
any topics you think should be discussed somebody 
responded saying this why do you treat your  

124
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,760
organizers like disposable garbage right now like 
on the surface you're thinking wow okay that's  

125
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,000
that's pretty intense right what's going 
on here so i responded to this person  

126
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,240
how do i have to switch this every time yeah i do 
so i responded to this person very simply saying

127
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,920
basically i responded saying okay give us give 
me some information i need to ask this question  

128
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,920
properly so this is the response i got when the 
allegations of fraud came up i commented on one of  

129
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,600
paul's comments stating something along the lines 
of it being standard practice to ask for financial  

130
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,080
information paul was very aggressive in his 
responses even abusive i told him i was one of the  

131
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,320
organizers and he told me to [ __ ] off and leave 
so i stood down these are not isolated incidents  

132
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,920
unfortunately his temper gets in the way and 
he burns his people his own people good luck so  

133
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,360
i i'm not saying that i don't believe that person 
and at the time i said you know okay i believe you  

134
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
but i need some evidence right i need something 
to show here do you have a screenshot do you have  

135
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:24,000
something to show me that i can show to them and 
uh you know i'm happy to discuss it and this is  

136
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,280
the answer that i got i don't he cleans up his 
message straight away i know you believe me but  

137
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,000
understand you need for proof you could perhaps 
pose the question more broadly is this is behavior  

138
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,960
as a pattern of his and so will be hard to deny 
sorry i can't help you any further david so  

139
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,280
it's pretty damning right this is pretty damning 
and at the time i gotta admit that i was a little  

140
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,880
bit like swayed because look i know paul and 
i know you both paul and the style and i know  

141
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,680
that sometimes you know i lose my [ __ ] too i 
say things that i later come to regret i've told  

142
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,800
people to [ __ ] off i've told i told someone to 
[ __ ] off live in a live stream by by accident  

143
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,680
i thought they were saying something that they 
weren't i told them to [ __ ] off and then they  

144
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,320
were like why what's wrong i only said this i 
got completely mixed up so it's not it's not  

145
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,440
like you know we're infallible we make mistakes 
but anyway i brought this up with you guys right  

146
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,240
and um luckily paul actually had the screenshots 
of this interaction now i'm going to show you what  

147
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,600
the actual interaction was actually hold up i 
just realized there's one little thing i need  

148
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,320
to blur out but you're not going to believe you're 
not going to believe what the actual interaction  

149
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,840
went like um on the surface of this it looks 
it obviously looks like it's a done deal right  

150
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,360
and i'm going to explain why this is relevant 
after i've shown you if you're wondering  

151
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,240
watching this if you're wondering what how is this 
relevant you'll see in a moment and i'd just like  

152
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,240
to add that this is how people commonly talk about 
they be when they say negative things about us  

153
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,680
yeah definitely definitely this is this is 
this is why i'm bringing it up it's it is  

154
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,840
absolutely like this and i want to get 
into this as a topic as well it's not just  

155
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,400
a thing but hey look so here we go this is the 
actual interaction so this is the individual  

156
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,880
saying the information requested is pretty 
standard for an audit so this is correct this  

157
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,560
is what she said no lies there okay that's in line 
with the message i received so here's paul being  

158
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,680
extremely aggressive apparently i don't know 
now requests bank login details to be handled  

159
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,040
handed over to a non-accountant and a 
former gang member how is that stuck  

160
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,360
that's how stock standard audit is carried out is 
it so that's the aggressive response apparently um  

161
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,040
this person responds saying you know she's upset 
because the it's calling joey a former gang member  

162
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,600
um and saying that screenshots could be 
manipulated and then paul goes to justify  

163
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,720
himself saying well joey calls himself 
an ex-gang member um okay so not not  

164
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,680
nothing really going on there no [ __ ] off 
nothing like that so far and it goes on you're  

165
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,520
thinking okay so where is the [ __ ] off coming 
where's the [ __ ] off and leave part coming right  

166
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,120
because that's the main part here that sounds 
horrible the aggressive [ __ ] off and leave  

167
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,200
um all we've got here is paul saying get out 
of here you said get out of here so let's not  

168
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,200
[ __ ] off and leave and then this person who 
was an organizer gets out of there she decides  

169
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,920
to leave and that's it that's it that's the whole 
interaction yeah can i just pause you there yeah  

170
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,800
go ahead uh so at this point i didn't even know 
that she was an organizer that's why she says in  

171
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,320
the next comment oh no paul bless you i am one of 
your organizers so she's now informed me of this  

172
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:38,320
after you said get out of here yeah so after the 
uh fact but yeah just wanted to that's it's okay  

173
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,240
yeah and that that's exactly it's even this is 
my point basically what i was talking about the  

174
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,760
whole nickelback thing and how these rumors get 
spread and it's cool to hate av it's because of  

175
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,280
things like this don't get me wrong i know 
there are examples out there of me being an  

176
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,200
[ __ ] to people and i'm sure there are examples 
out there of you guys being an [ __ ] to people  

177
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,240
but to go and actually take something that didn't 
happen and get it into your head that it happened  

178
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,440
a certain way where you know you were told to [ 
__ ] off and leave as an organizer and you know  

179
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,319
people believe this and and this goes and goes 
and goes and i guess my question for you is how  

180
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,119
does this happen how do we get to the point now 
where we have people that believe that they have  

181
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,919
been wronged by you they believe it so much that 
they go and tell other people they were wronged by  

182
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,800
you that they were told to [ __ ] off when there 
is literal evidence that you have obviously and  

183
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,560
it's online to show that this is not how it went 
why does it happen and why do people believe it  

184
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,400
instantly without even checking or questioning it 
like how did we get to this point in your opinion  

185
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:47,760
it's for the same reason that you get hate when 
people choose to run hate campaign small or large  

186
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,520
against you and their baseless claims it's the 
same reason that anyone of any amount of influence  

187
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:05,760
in this day and age in this age of outrage you 
know in this council culture this is the way  

188
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:14,720
that it works right people don't work off people 
don't have standards for information anymore then  

189
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,840
they don't hear something and then screen 
it they hear something and they say well  

190
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,320
he said it with conviction or she said it with 
conviction or they said it with conviction and  

191
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,360
therefore it must be true and if they said it 
in the comments section of a post with emotion

192
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,160
it's true it doesn't you don't need 
to do any more homework than that so  

193
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,520
i guess that question is a bit more deeper it's 
it's it's more of a question about why humans are  

194
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:55,840
the way humans are yeah yeah and and yeah i can 
see so you think you you're putting it down to the  

195
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,040
the more the popularity aspect of it in that like 
the more the more well-known an individual or a  

196
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,560
group is the more of this that's going 
to come is that is that am i right and  

197
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,080
understanding this is kind of the point yeah 
and you know a lot of our organizers have had  

198
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:20,800
challenges in dealing with hate that they get when 
they come on to become an organizer and represent  

199
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:27,120
av in their cities because they're seen 
as like working for hitler you know right  

200
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,600
and yeah you know we we tell organizers 
one of the things you learn about being  

201
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:41,600
a human rights activist when you work 
with us is dealing with that [ __ ]

202
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:49,200
right and that's part of it if you want to do 
something of influence within this world and make  

203
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:59,200
an impact i i i agree so um let's yeah i think 
i think that's a that's going to be a recurring  

204
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,160
topic to be honest with you so let's let's go 
on to the like more let's go on to a solid topic  

205
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,040
something we can really like get into and kind of 
debunk so one of the more common things that came  

206
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,120
up with my questions that came up questions that 
came up sorry topics that came up was about money  

207
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,000
now we talked about the donor obviously but we 
didn't talk about the general things that people  

208
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,840
seem to be obsessing over when it comes 
to av so these general money concerns as  

209
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,600
i've called on my general money concerns they 
include things like people are upset because  

210
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,360
you guys didn't want to release financial records 
they're upset because apparently that they don't  

211
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:45,120
know or you have not released where donations go 
um they're upset because they the the chapters  

212
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,360
are claiming they receive no money um so so i know 
you've dealt with some of this on your own channel  

213
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,120
and i'm on your own videos and i guess you're sick 
of talking about it but again my aim today is to  

214
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,960
get into it and and to ask maybe more questions 
that maybe people haven't you guys maybe haven't  

215
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:10,240
had before and to get really some solid facts and 
detail out here so that people can't continue to  

216
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,720
discuss this randomly like you said i feel like we 
need to vet these things rather than just taking  

217
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,880
people's words um so what what is that situation 
then so let's let's be more specific with the  

218
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:27,200
question there's money coming in and obviously 
there's money going out um people are claiming  

219
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,960
that there's a problem that they don't know what's 
coming in and where it's going so how how would  

220
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,720
you respond to that like what what do you think 
uh how can you reassure these people that it's  

221
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,840
going where it should be or you know what the 
situation is what the financial situation is  

222
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,840
i think going back to what you were saying 
before about like how it's the cool thing  

223
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,760
now to hate on av it's also the cool thing 
to just ask these questions because you don't  

224
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,400
you don't see other organizations or other 
activists being asked the same questions and the  

225
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,880
people that are asking these questions and making 
the same claims don't have any kind of evidence to  

226
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,840
back up their claim so it's just because somebody 
brought it up in the comment section and they saw  

227
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,840
it they're just going to repeat it and then the 
next person is going to say the same thing so  

228
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,400
um like the fact that we have never 
done any financial reports is actually  

229
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,160
[ __ ] because it's not that we're not 
willing to do it as that we haven't been  

230
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:35,680
required to do it yet and if anyone is actually 
interested all of this information is public so  

231
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,840
they can just go and look it up and they 
will have access to and they can see that  

232
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:49,440
um we're required to do our first financial um 
what is it called like reporting this year end  

233
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,840
of the year or it's probably going to be delayed 
next year actually because of coverage but  

234
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:01,360
because we registered av as a non-for-profit 
i think it was in 2018 the way it works here  

235
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,040
you don't you're not asked to do a reporting for 
like the first year or the first couple of years  

236
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:16,240
so it's not that we because otherwise we wouldn't 
be able to run av if we hadn't done our um legal  

237
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,720
requirements whatever it is that you know the 
government is asking you to do as a not-for-profit  

238
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,800
it's not like you can just say no i'm not going 
to do my reporting and then you can continue to  

239
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:34,400
run av as a not-for-profit so um yeah like i said 
these claims are just faceless there's no evidence  

240
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,520
and also people have no reason to think that 
the money is not going where we say it's going  

241
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,360
if somebody has proof that the money is going 
elsewhere then they need to come forward and  

242
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,560
show us where the money is going um we have 
explained this like you said multiple times  

243
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,200
we have told people where the money is going 
like with all these different categories so we  

244
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,960
can just repeat that but i feel like these people 
are committed to think a certain way and no matter  

245
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,960
what you say they're just not gonna believe you so 
yeah i i just don't know if there's anything else  

246
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,520
that we can say to clarify this for people yeah 
i i guess for the sake of for the sake of this um  

247
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,120
for the sake of this stream i don't want i i don't 
i'm not interested in going through literally like  

248
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,200
i wouldn't expect you to do this to go through 
like okay we spend this much here and this much  

249
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,400
i don't want to do that that's just it's not you 
don't owe that to people watching this i think  

250
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,840
what i'm more interested in is like maybe you 
could just list off like the things that i  

251
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,720
don't know the biggest spending from av and like 
where it goes to give people an idea because uh  

252
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,360
maybe some people genuinely have no idea where 
an organization like av would spend money let's  

253
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,720
assume they're asking it out of you know interest 
rather than out of accusation like if somebody  

254
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,320
asked you hey i'm just curious like where would 
it go like where do you spend the most money how  

255
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,840
would you answer that question like just just to 
appear appease them let's say or just to you know  

256
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:12,480
like the major donations coming in um so the 
biggest part of it would obviously be the payments  

257
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:20,320
to the team members so including myself paul 
and um at some point we had just over 30 people  

258
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,720
working with av so you can imagine how much that 
would cost roughly and then now we've got i think  

259
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,920
i don't know actually how many people we've got 
like around 20 people working with us including  

260
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:42,240
us too so the the bulk of it is going towards 
payments so that those people can continue to  

261
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:50,800
work for av and then the second biggest um thing 
has always been the av fund which is something  

262
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:58,080
that we started um and we would dedicate a certain 
amount of money to go towards chapters that were  

263
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,000
um you know active chapters that needed some help 
getting their equipment so that was always like  

264
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:13,680
the second um biggest expense for us and then yeah 
the rest of it is just you know if if people look  

265
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,680
into what costs are involved in terms of you know 
all the admin stuff all the programs that you need  

266
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,840
the software's the subscriptions and then all 
the big campaigns that we were doing as well so  

267
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:37,040
okay and with the staff they were 30 were they 
all full-time 30 staff um no we had so we um  

268
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,480
we have people that work with us as 
contractors so av doesn't have like staff  

269
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,880
necessarily but um everyone's like an independent 
contractor that comes in and they can do  

270
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:57,360
um part-time or full-time and um i think i would 
say maybe it's half-half half of the people that  

271
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,520
work with us are full-time half are part-time 
um or just come in as volunteers even sometimes  

272
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,680
they they do some work casually yeah cool okay 
cause i'm just trying to like put a number on it  

273
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:15,440
i think for anyone who maybe is not following um 
it's like 30 staff if you had 30 staff that were  

274
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,760
only working let's say like not full-time hours 
late so they're working part-time hours right  

275
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,920
so let's imagine it's 30 staff working 20 
hours a week so we'll go like we'll go low  

276
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,280
right we'll pitch low here 30 staff working 
20 hours a week and let's imagine that the  

277
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,840
i'm going to work in yearly salaries here 
like base yearly salary in euros for example  

278
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,720
the absolute minimum you could earn a year to 
survive in a place like i don't know let's pick  

279
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,360
a cheap let's baseline everything low let's go low 
on everything the minimum you could earn in a year  

280
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,400
in somewhere like spain for example 
would be like because that's where i know  

281
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,520
it's like 16 000 euros a year it's the absolute 
minimum and that's really pushing it like it's  

282
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,720
really difficult and that would be a full-time 
salary so that's like that's half that 8 000  

283
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,040
a year and let's imagine that's 30 staff that's 
240 000 euros a year that's a that's pitching low  

284
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,560
that's if you have no full-time staff that's 
if all of your staff are only working like  

285
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,120
like half-time hours let's imagine right so 
just to put that into perspective for anyone  

286
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,240
who's wondering how much that would be so like it 
could it could be anywhere upwards from 240 000  

287
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,680
euros a year which would be like i don't know 300 
000 us dollars maybe something like that so that  

288
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,440
is that is a huge chunk yeah and i think uh when 
i when i first watched the video and i heard that  

289
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,280
and i worked it out myself at that time and i 
was like yeah that's actually a chunk of money  

290
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,800
that i don't think many people understand right 
um it doesn't it doesn't sound like a lot but  

291
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,720
when you actually calculated it is quite a lot so 
um the next thing then you talked about the the av  

292
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,280
uh fund the for the for the chapters 
where has it come from then that that  

293
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,360
does this apparently this is a rumor okay there's 
no i don't have evidence of this and i'm sure  

294
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,000
there isn't evidence of this uh maybe there's one 
or two organizers who have caused this problem  

295
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,720
but where is it coming from that the chapters are 
not getting the funding where has that started do  

296
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,120
you know where that came from or do you know 
what's going what what is actually behind it  

297
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,800
like are they getting the funding i'm sorry to ask 
the question but it came it came up a lot again  

298
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,040
no i think it's the same thing as everything 
else like somebody just started this rumor  

299
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:24,320
that av keeps the money or specifically paul and 
assad keep the money to themselves and they don't  

300
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:30,240
send any money to the chapters i think it's just 
again we don't even know where this came from but  

301
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:36,640
if people were really interested this is one 
thing that can be easily tracked we have a  

302
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,640
full list of everyone who ever received the fund 
how much they received it what they spent it on  

303
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,960
and um because everyone who receives the fund they 
were supposed to send us the invoices so it's like  

304
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:58,960
we have all the records and um i guess the only 
thing is that we weren't um doing it in a way  

305
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,480
that just as as soon as you become an organizer 
you can receive two thousand dollars or something  

306
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,040
it was there were certain criterias that you 
you need to meet as an organizer or as a chapter  

307
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,400
you need to be active you need to be doing a 
minimum number of cubes and you need to be you  

308
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:23,440
know operating for a certain amount of time and 
then even with that because the money was limited  

309
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,880
we had to pick chapters so sometimes it 
was just you know picking this chapter  

310
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,520
over the other chapter and then next month they 
would have a higher chance of getting it but  

311
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,120
um yeah there will be many organizers that would 
actually be able to come forward and say yeah we  

312
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:46,000
received that and this is what we spent it on but 
i mean our conditions for our criteria for being  

313
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,640
accepted in in getting the funding was nothing 
crazy like you had to be on board for six months  

314
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:58,960
you know just six months and do one a month 
i think that's what yeah one cube a month so  

315
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,880
you had to do a total amount of six cubes before 
we would we would look at giving you money yeah  

316
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,120
and yeah you know that's nothing that's nothing 
too strenuous i think what's happened is  

317
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:21,600
a lot of organizers don't really pay attention 
to what we do they they come on and they just do  

318
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,200
their own thing in their own cities and they want 
to be a king or a queen in their own on their own  

319
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,400
mountains and and literally we've seen so many 
people come and go who carry this attitude with  

320
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,080
the navy they just do their own thing in their own 
city and they aren't a part of what we're doing  

321
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,120
as a global movement and uh and these 
people don't really pay attention to  

322
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:55,120
the things that we have going on yeah and they 
don't really know about these uh things to any

323
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,920
20 details so they don't apply and then they 
complain that they never got the money right um  

324
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,000
how do you how do you think we can handle that i 
mean this is uh not even an av specific thing but  

325
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,280
we can we can talk about it for a second that it's 
something i've also experienced not only in av but  

326
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:24,560
in save and also in um in even you know grassroots 
like none like local grassroots organizations  

327
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,960
local grassroots groups is that there seems to 
always be some kind of power struggle going on  

328
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,360
in these groups i don't know if it's only within 
animal rights or if it's also within i don't know  

329
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,440
women's rights if it's in black lives matter i 
don't know if it's in all these groups i i've not  

330
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,840
been in those groups for enough time to know but 
in animal rights it seems to be that in every  

331
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,480
single group there is a power struggle of somebody 
trying to take over and somebody else who's trying  

332
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,040
to take over that person and you know somebody 
who's trying to reject the leader they have or  

333
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,080
whatever you want to call them leader whatever 
it is it's it's it seems to be very common like  

334
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,160
what do you think what's causing that and uh would 
you have a suggestion on on how to how to fix that

335
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,840
well you know one of the things 
i'm really proud of with av  

336
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,120
is that we really took into account like 
how we're taken by the public and the fact  

337
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,960
that we want to be taken seriously and like we 
want to address that within the public eye and

338
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:29,520
we don't necessarily expect people to trust our 
leadership to like trust our decision making  

339
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:38,240
but i think it's safe to say we've earned a 
certain level of trust because you know we  

340
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,800
stick to our ship pretty well and 
we do what we do pretty well and

341
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:53,120
and uh those who choose to trust our leadership 
aren't forced to choose that they choose it  

342
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:02,400
on their own accord and i guess if you want 
that entitlement that asylum i have earned to  

343
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:09,360
run an organization the way that we choose 
then you should start your own organization  

344
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:17,120
sure if you come on to some come on board with 
someone else you know you choose to volunteer  

345
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:26,000
or you choose to work for an organization and 
you're on boarding their ethos and representing  

346
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:36,880
what their movement is about you really have no 
right to say you shouldn't make the decisions

347
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,200
sure sure so the idea is kind of do you think 
the baby should be some kind of i don't know  

348
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:53,120
um let's say a self-reflection with people who 
who join groups or who start to work with not  

349
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,960
just av but with any group really that if 
you are going to volunteer with a group um  

350
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,200
i guess you need to learn that maybe your ideas 
won't always be accepted by the current i don't  

351
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,080
know manager leader organizer of that group and 
if you don't like it then that's absolutely fine  

352
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,040
you either continue volunteering or you create 
your own thing and do it your way it's basically  

353
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,240
is that am i is that what you're saying basically 
what yeah because like of course we always welcome  

354
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,440
feedback but welcoming feedback doesn't mean we're 
going to take it on board we're going to discuss  

355
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,320
it between us too and then the team that we have 
and then we might take it on board or we may not  

356
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,400
but to expect that every single feedback is just 
going to be accepted and we're going to implement  

357
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:46,560
that idea whatever it might be i think that's very 
unrealistic yeah it will be very chaotic so yes if  

358
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:54,240
somebody doesn't like the fact that you know their 
feedback wasn't accepted then i think if they feel  

359
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,760
like they're not aligned with the organization 
then they should just do their own thing i mean  

360
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,000
that just makes sense to me it's just very common 
yeah and you know i think you clarified but just  

361
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,160
to make sure just to make sure that no one is 
confused by what we're saying here we're not  

362
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,800
saying you know if you if you have any input you 
know you have any feedback you have any criticism  

363
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,040
as a represent as a representative of 
ab whether you're an organizer volunteer

364
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
we're not saying that we're just going to 
say [ __ ] you and go do your own thing  

365
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:39,600
that's not how we operate we and like to think 
that we've only ever enacted ideas that have come  

366
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:47,120
from either my brain or a cell's brain is insane 
we've always taken on feedback from others  

367
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,480
and taken it into account and i think the 
last thing i want people to consider here is  

368
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:00,240
where would av be today like really think 
about where a baby would be today if we  

369
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:08,560
weren't operating the way that we are if we 
ran a system where we had like a board of um

370
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,960
you know board of directors 
where we only had a vote  

371
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,440
into what was and we only had two votes of many  

372
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:30,720
into what was being decided on i mean i think it's 
i i think it's clear that av wouldn't be clear  

373
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:39,920
about the message and i don't think that we would 
be where we are today that leads on to another  

374
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,480
point quite nicely actually because i think what 
i feel like you're hinting at here is that that  

375
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,280
if you didn't maintain control you feel 
that av would go down the same road as  

376
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
pretty much every other ar organization 
has gone down where they are bringing in  

377
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,600
uh human issues um human rights issues and 
basically kind of i guess i guess if you could put  

378
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,720
in a way that they're moving with the times rather 
than staying true to what they started for if  

379
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,360
that makes sense um and some people would say that 
that is a positive thing you know to move with the  

380
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:17,280
times because let's be honest the you know the the 
times are very much changing and you know a lot of  

381
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,240
human rights issues have very much been thrown to 
the front and that's not necessarily a bad thing  

382
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:29,120
um but you could argue that ar organizations 
also taking those fights on board is some  

383
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:34,560
some and i guess you would argue that is a bad 
thing and that brings me to another question that  

384
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,400
has been asked or let's say a topic that has been 
brought up uh the topic of anti-intersectionality  

385
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,680
and uh and you know what this means with with av 
what intersect or not intersectionality i don't  

386
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,560
think that's even the correct thing to talk to 
to say because i don't intersectionality itself  

387
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,480
i'm sure we all if there's anybody in this in 
this chat or even you guys that say disagrees  

388
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,040
with the concept of it i would just say you're 
disagreeing with facts right if the fact is that  

389
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,800
intersexuality as it was originally coined 
it's it's factual it's like you know someone  

390
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,880
who's female or black will experience the world 
differently to someone who's male and white or  

391
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,480
someone who's female and white or someone who's 
you know transgender and black or transgender  

392
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,240
everyone experiences the world differently and has 
different challenges right that's what it means  

393
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,680
that's literally what it means not what vegans 
have made it that's [ __ ] so we all will agree  

394
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,080
that that's what it means i'm sure and i you 
know i guess no one really would would say it  

395
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,760
would argue against that it's just logic it's just 
factual but let's say uh the they call themselves  

396
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,320
consistent anti-oppression crowd let's say and and 
this is something that you have get like more than  

397
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,800
once you've stood out stood up against and you've 
said said some things about you know the animals  

398
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,360
first um approach non-humans first approach um 
and this has been widely criticized and a lot  

399
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:59,440
of people have even you know people make videos 
about this they are constantly attacking you guys  

400
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,040
for this they are people um saying they won't they 
won't go to av events because of this um so yeah  

401
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,720
this is the topic we're going to get into i'll ask 
you a question someone just asked this question  

402
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,400
earlier uh why do intersectionals intersectionals 
not like you that's what someone said so that's  

403
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,840
an easy question to start with why do these 
people hate you why are they coming for you  

404
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,840
why are they trying to cancel you why are 
they trying to ruin um your organization

405
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,520
you want to go only um yeah i i guess 
yeah like you you already explained that  

406
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:42,480
it's not that we're anti-intersectional um we 
just made a decision that av is going to be 100  

407
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,600
dedicated to the animals non-human animals and 
there are many reasons why we decided on that  

408
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,720
but that doesn't mean that we don't think or 
anyone within the organization not just us too  

409
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:05,040
doesn't believe that other groups of beings need 
um voices to speak up for them or we shouldn't be  

410
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,200
doing activism in different areas so it's again 
it's just the way that people decide to interpret  

411
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:18,480
this like someone decided that because av is 100 
dedicated to non-human animals that means that  

412
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:25,600
we have hatred towards humans or we there's 
discrimination when it comes to certain groups  

413
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:34,480
of humans and they're just running with that 
idea i think it's easy to paint that image of us  

414
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:44,320
given that we are aware of the fact that we 
dedicate av 100 to animal rights in light  

415
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:53,520
of a temp the temperament currently in society is 
that anyone who does such a thing must also pander  

416
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,480
to human rights otherwise it's totally out 
of place so we're completely aware of this  

417
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:06,560
and we still won't pander so it's easy to 
paint us like that but we don't care because  

418
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,600
we want for this to exist in the world we 
want a movement who is still willing to just  

419
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:22,880
do the right thing in the face of what is popular 
in the moment and you've been also a popular thing  

420
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,920
that comes up when discussing these things 
is the the idea of a hierarchy of oppression  

421
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,200
of which it it appears that you that you guys do 
um have a hierarchy as in you i've heard at least  

422
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,280
you paul especially i've heard this but i 
don't know if i'm sure you've said it as well  

423
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,600
and this is not an attack it's just you 
know just quoting um that the animals  

424
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,640
are by far the most depressed beings on the 
planet right and some people get upset about  

425
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,320
that because they say that you're creating a 
hierarchy of oppression and apparently this is  

426
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,040
this is uh this is wrong um how do you 
respond to that um that's disrespectful  

427
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,840
and it's a spit in the face of every animal 
that that is subjected to that injustice  

428
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,840
you know you can you can act like you're 
offended by these semantics all you want  

429
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,280
but just remember that while your charade is going 
on you're spitting in the face of the victims who  

430
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,400
are involved in the injustice that you're carrying 
on about and that's my response to that it's just  

431
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,400
simple that we shouldn't have to explain that 
we're not saying that humans aren't oppressed

432
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:50,640
um yeah like what you said doesn't sound 
like something that resonates with me  

433
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:59,280
the hierarchy of depression but it is a fact 
that the animals well okay so in terms of the  

434
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,320
number of individual animals who have been 
tortured and abused and murdered compared to  

435
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:12,240
any other injustice that's literally what we're 
talking about so i don't think it's i don't think  

436
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,000
it means like if anyone takes that as so you're 
saying there is a hierarchy of oppression meaning  

437
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:25,680
this group is more oppressed or we should speak 
up for them first that's not what we're saying you  

438
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,280
can't take that from from saying you know animals 
are the most suppressed meaning they have been  

439
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,960
um they have been oppressed for the longest and 
the number of individual victims is higher than  

440
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,480
any other injustice that's just the fact that's 
the reality of it and you're right if somebody  

441
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,840
gets upset because of that then i think they 
need to just reflect on why that is because  

442
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:58,320
i know that there are people out there that were 
more oppressed than me as as a woman of color  

443
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:03,040
and so therefore anyone else in any other 
group then they should know that there are  

444
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,760
other beings you know that are more oppressed than 
themselves and that doesn't take away from their  

445
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:17,440
pain or their suffering that's how i see it i 
mean how more audacious could you possibly be  

446
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:26,480
as a human being any human being to say 
you're more oppressed than a group of beings  

447
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:37,200
enslaved tortured and murdered by the trillion 
with a t every year when was the last genocide  

448
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:49,360
of one billion with a b humans oh wait crickets 
a billion i'm talking three trillion with a t  

449
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,160
are subjected to this injustice every single year 
it's happening every second of every day doesn't  

450
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:03,520
need to be explained to vegans of course but hello 
don't get mad at us for being a medium of truth  

451
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,160
yeah i think um just to add to that i think this 
is this is a point that i i agree on i mean i'm i  

452
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,760
guess i'm not supposed to be sharing my personal 
views here i am interviewing you but i have to  

453
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,960
say i agree with you because um i don't believe 
that it's down to emotions this point i believe  

454
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,840
it's down to the facts and it's objectively 
true it's it's it's not something that can  

455
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,480
even be argued against and anyone who's tried to 
argue against even with me the arguments it just  

456
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,080
falls to pieces because you can't possibly claim 
that any other animal on the planet is abused  

457
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:42,720
or any any human animal on the planet is abused or 
or exploited or objectified more than a non-human  

458
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:48,240
the non-humans don't even have political rights or 
voices like it's it's not even about how much they  

459
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:53,040
say even if we forget how many of them are abused 
in the severity the fact that they literally have  

460
00:46:53,040 --> 00:47:00,640
no say at all in their own lives um like none 
none whatsoever no legal almost no legal rights  

461
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,160
you know um it's it's enough you know it's enough 
to just even go from that even if it wasn't three  

462
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,440
trillion that alone is enough of a point you know 
but at that and the fact there's three trillion  

463
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:18,080
of them being you know horrifically murdered 
it's it's it's yeah it's a crazy point to try to  

464
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,960
to try to argue against that in my opinion and i'm 
always surprised when vegans try to argue against  

465
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:29,040
it it's i mean i mean nothing really surprises 
me anymore actually but but yeah it's slightly  

466
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:36,880
more surprised with that um i've got a question 
uh do you think this is this came from a a uh  

467
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,440
instagramer i think uh do you think it's 
speciesist to ignore human oppression while  

468
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,840
fighting for non-human animals that was that was 
a question that somebody wanted to ask you guys

469
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:55,200
you know i know that people aren't 
attuned to nuance and context but  

470
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:02,960
it is required for us to answer this 
question uh as a general statement yeah like  

471
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,520
the way you ask that of course not like yeah 
sorry the question was is it is it speciesist  

472
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,960
do you think it yeah do you think it is personally 
do you find it to be is that is that an example  

473
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,400
of speciesism basically yes when i hear that 
question as a blanket statement like that yes  

474
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:31,520
because it sounds like otherwise you're going to 
say otherwise you're denying that group of things  

475
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,720
like their existence and their suffering and 
their oppression so yeah of course it is but  

476
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,440
yeah like we need an example or an explanation 
of why because is that because again because  

477
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,320
av is 100 focused on non-human animals or is this 
question directed at us personally and people are  

478
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:57,280
wondering if we do other forms of activism or we 
care about other poison forms of injustice every  

479
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,480
every day we make a post on social media about 
non-human animals every day we set up cube of  

480
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:10,240
truth action on the streets those energies are 
spent on fighting for non-human animals while  

481
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,760
human injustices are occurring within human human 
to human injustices are occurring around the world  

482
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,920
at that time so if at a general level you 
want to say because of our answer we're  

483
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,240
technically ignoring all of these other 
injustices while we're doing that well  

484
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,920
there's no such there's no point of even 
trying to like there's no nuance at all  

485
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,640
in a way that someone would think if 
that's the conclusion they're trying  

486
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,920
yeah yeah i think i would add to that and i 
don't think it's speciesism because you're not uh  

487
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,880
you're not not fighting for humans i'm not i'm not 
not fighting for humans because i think humans are  

488
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,120
somehow inferior i'm choosing to fight for 
non-humans because i believe that well not  

489
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:03,680
i believe they are um in more need simple as that 
so that's my how i answer that question is is that  

490
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,680
way it's not speciesism because i'm not doing 
it because of the species i'm doing it because  

491
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:13,840
of the severity of the situation we've never 
even said the term animals first human second  

492
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,320
like that's come from other people we've 
never said that before right right what we've  

493
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:26,400
never said is animals deserve to have a cause 
dedicated solely to them and so av will be that

494
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,880
sure i actually i i don't know if i've ever heard 
you say that i don't think i don't think i have  

495
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,960
and something but some people have messaged 
that so if anyone's watching right now and you  

496
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,200
you feel like you have some evidence of that then 
you're more than welcome to send it and we'll  

497
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,840
discuss it and you know but i i yeah it's it's 
something that does keep coming up and that goes  

498
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,800
for other things by the way if you're watching 
now and we we go through something and and you  

499
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:56,560
know but we discuss our poorness i've never said 
that or this has not happened and you think it has  

500
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,480
you just send me a message with what you think has 
happened or within with evidence of it and we'll  

501
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,360
we'll talk about it right now we're not we're not 
here to hide away from things and you know paul  

502
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:10,480
and us how you agreed to come on here to actually 
directly face some of these things you know so if  

503
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,280
anyone does have something that they feel should 
be directly faced just send it me on instagram or  

504
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,200
a messenger or email or you know tag tag me in 
the comments and tell me you're gonna send it on  

505
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,480
messenger or whatever and i'll and i'll pick it 
up and we'll bring it up on the screen and we'll  

506
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,720
talk about it like we're not we're not hiding 
anything but i've got a sneaky suspicion that  

507
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:33,840
that's not gonna happen because most of the stuff 
we're talking about is just rumor and you know  

508
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,320
it's i don't think there's a lot 
of evidence behind it to be honest  

509
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:44,960
um yeah but um let's let's i think we're still on 
intersectionality and i think i feel like we maybe  

510
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,640
want to delve into that just a little bit further 
um i guess what i guess your guys stance on it i  

511
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,840
mean somebody asked the question here saying what 
are you doing to make your activism intersectional  

512
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:01,200
somebody asked that uh of you guys and and i was 
thinking like how can i really ask that because i  

513
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,280
don't i don't know if it's something that you 
actually are trying to do um i don't i know  

514
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,800
that there was a i know there was a change of 
direction recently as to i don't know not be so  

515
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,680
i don't know what the word is to be more sensitive 
i think with your own words um because maybe in  

516
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,600
the past there was a little bit of insensitivity 
but i guess yeah what would you say to someone  

517
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,840
who's asking you that how what are you doing 
to make your activism more intersectional  

518
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:31,840
we're not trying to do that like you said but 
that's not the goal there's no need for us to  

519
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:38,960
try to do that and let's just cut the [ __ ] here 
people who say this are not actually asking us  

520
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:45,280
to adopt anti-oppression values within 
our organization because we already have  

521
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:53,760
those what they're asking us to do is become 
activists for human related issues and we are  

522
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:02,640
dedicated to non-human animals sorry not sorry 
so you draw you draw a line i guess uh between  

523
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,440
not contributing to other oppressions 
are they drawing a line sorry between  

524
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,960
not contributing to other oppressions and being 
active for other oppressions and they feel that  

525
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,080
because you are on the not contributing side 
of the line that therefore means that you are  

526
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,320
wrong and that you should be actually active 
for those oppressions too correct they want us  

527
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:28,560
to be on the streets showing footage of 
what's happening in the blm movement or

528
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,920
with regards to homelessness or feminism or 
i guess whatever the mainstream issue is of  

529
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,920
the times but going back to what you were 
saying earlier about like the definition of  

530
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:49,200
intersectionality it actually doesn't apply here 
because sure you can be an animal rights activist  

531
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,840
you can also be a human rights activist in what 
that whatever area you want to work in but um  

532
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,800
what's the relationship between like any of those 
things that you mentioned and animals suffering  

533
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,800
you know what i mean there is no relationship 
so i i don't think it actually makes sense  

534
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:17,840
to ask that of us so how are we gonna make it 
work with that even if that was something we  

535
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:24,400
were looking at doing how are you gonna connect 
homelessness to animal suffering in the meat  

536
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:31,280
dairy and egg industry i mean we get asked to 
speak up about various issues and it is really  

537
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:40,240
only about what is popular at that time what is 
being spoken about at that time and it's not about  

538
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:47,520
these issues that cause a vast number of deaths 
around the world for example in the middle east  

539
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:55,120
that never gets spoken about that we're aware 
of because we have heritage in the middle east  

540
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:01,360
we know about these things these people for 
example who were outraged about what was going on  

541
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,680
in america during the protests in minnesota 
and throughout other states said really  

542
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:13,120
nothing about what happened in lebanon 
for example yeah they are very selective  

543
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:21,440
the causes that they choose to speak up about and 
that's the thing because when people ask us to do  

544
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:29,280
the same thing they're asking us to to speak up 
for those specific issues um because you know how  

545
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,600
many different things are out there that you could 
be speaking about when it comes to human rights  

546
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:42,080
there are so many different things and i don't 
know anyone who claims to be an intersectional  

547
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:47,760
and they actually cover all of those issues 
there's literally thousands of different  

548
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,360
things that you could talk about and i i only see 
these people focusing on two or three different  

549
00:55:53,360 --> 00:56:00,160
categories and they want us to do the same and 
that points out that you do have to choose your  

550
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,040
cause yeah because if they're claiming you 
have to speak up for all of them well there's  

551
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:11,040
literally thousands of injustices occurring 
right now around the world all the time so  

552
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,480
it's not only impractical it's impossible 
for you to physically pull that off to  

553
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:24,160
actually speak up for all of them yeah and to 
fight to end all of them all at once i mean  

554
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:31,360
think about how insane that is so these people are 
being hypocrites because these people are choosing  

555
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:38,720
their causes which is guess what we have you have 
our support you have our full support to do that  

556
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:45,760
because we chose a cause yeah and that's how it is 
you guys are doing the same thing that we're doing  

557
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,720
how about we i'm actually taking this moment 
to see where we have something in common  

558
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:57,280
and maybe you should do the same thing instead of 
looking at where we have a difference or where you  

559
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:04,320
think you're more holier than that or something 
to that effect have you considered this before  

560
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,440
there's a concept that actually if i i'll tell 
you who who introduced me to it but um this was  

561
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,680
actually back in the day when things were a little 
bit nicer but it was actually anita who introduced  

562
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:19,840
me to this concept um years like maybe a year and 
a half ago two years ago when i i brought up the i  

563
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,000
brought up some comments about insectionality and 
i kind of warned anita that it looked like this  

564
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,960
was going to start to take a turn for the worse 
people were starting to attack me for not you know  

565
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,360
saying certain things or for saying certain things 
and i felt like it was starting to seep into  

566
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:39,520
organizations and i mentioned this and she told me 
we won't do this because we are all about positive  

567
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,840
intersectionality and she had this concept and 
this mindset and it really inspired me actually  

568
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:50,560
because she said we can fight for the animals 
100 always but when there are situations where  

569
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:57,760
it also benefits humans we can also note it for 
example look these vegans went out and gave free  

570
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,880
food that are homeless because they're suffering 
they're doing animal rights activism by teaching  

571
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,600
the homeless about veganism and they're helping 
the homeless for example that would be a positive  

572
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:13,200
intersectional message right it's not no one 
loses out here the animals are focused and  

573
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:18,800
the the homeless people have a focus in lebanon 
for example with the blast the the vegans the  

574
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:24,800
local vegans were doing incredible work they were 
getting like food out to everyone they were like  

575
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,400
you know um helping the vegan businesses in 
the area they were helping the animals in the  

576
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:33,920
area it was it was amazing but you're also raising 
awareness of that corrupt government and how this  

577
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,360
even happened in the first place it's it's two in 
one it's easy right um and this was great when she  

578
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,360
said this i was really inspired but obviously we 
know how that went and it didn't end up staying  

579
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:48,480
um staying that way unfortunately but for you guys 
like what do you think about av in that sense do  

580
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,040
you think this is something av could do like with 
social media i mean not with the cubes but like  

581
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,640
with how you represent yourselves on social 
media is that something that you've thought about  

582
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,440
or would ever consider or you do you have do 
you disagree with that that kind of way of doing  

583
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:09,920
things what way of doing things specifically 
what is being suggested so so like for example  

584
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:16,480
when there are some um when there is there are 
issues that potentially could be both benefited by  

585
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,520
raising awareness of it for example you obviously 
av is 100 focused on the animals but let's imagine  

586
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,480
there is uh some of your av organizers or 
your av team goes out and gives food to the  

587
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,440
homeless raising putting that on av social 
media and saying like look look look at what  

588
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,520
our awesome activists are doing they're fighting 
for the animals and they're helping the homeless  

589
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,920
do you see some pro a problem with doing something 
like that or do you think that that you agree with  

590
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:48,720
that as a as an idea that specific suggestion just 
sounds like we would be i don't see how that helps

591
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,120
a human cause of any kind 
by making a post like that  

592
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:02,880
i don't see that as activism to help a human 
cause i mean at best it's congratulatory and  

593
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:08,800
supportive of individuals within 
our network who are doing that uh

594
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:16,800
i don't see that as activism though i don't see 
that as like fighting a human rights cause of  

595
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:23,440
some kind no i guess not but i guess it would be 
raising awareness that homeless people need food  

596
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,640
i know people know that or maybe inspiring other 
vegans to go out and outreach homeless people and  

597
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,800
give them food i don't know it's an idea it's 
just it's just an idea as is what i mean it's  

598
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,840
it's something that uh like i don't know if it 
even would count as intersectionality in that  

599
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,800
case but for example the lebanon example would 
because they they have the corrupt government  

600
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:48,080
they are they're oppressing their people um making 
someone making a post or making a video on that  

601
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:51,120
where you're saying hey look at what these 
awesome vegans are doing they're fighting a  

602
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,360
corrupt government and they're also saving animals 
and they're getting people food that that would be  

603
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:02,000
a better example of of how to raise awareness of 
two oppressions um in one without either of them  

604
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,240
losing anything if that makes sense because 
it's not like we're just talking about  

605
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,040
you know lebanon we're talking about vegan and 
activists in lebanon so like then it becomes  

606
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:16,320
something that encompasses all of it you 
know but i mean i i'm a bit confused because

607
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:27,040
i don't see how it was like an animal rights 
uh thing that they did they're just vegans  

608
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:32,720
people who don't abuse and torture animals 
animal rights activists who went and did  

609
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:42,560
a deed for humans and that deed was a human rights 
good that they did and when they were doing that  

610
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,960
that act that deed had nothing to do with the 
animals really it was just about i think david was  

611
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,360
saying that they were kind of outreaching people 
when they were giving them the food were they  

612
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,520
yeah i believe they were i don't know 
this for sure but i believe they were  

613
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,760
sending out like leaflets and stuff with the 
with the bags and also they were rescuing animals  

614
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,800
too they were actually rescuing animals 
off the street and getting them treated  

615
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,120
they were raising money for that too so they 
were doing a few yeah it was like uh it was  

616
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,360
yeah they were doing a few a few different things 
to try and help the animals and also the people  

617
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,360
yeah i didn't know the full extent of the campaign 
that they carried out over there uh i all i know  

618
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,360
is at the time i reached out and you know i 
checked in with them and i was just wanting to  

619
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:29,840
know if they were okay during the whole blast but 
i forgive my ignorance to those who were carrying  

620
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:35,840
out that awesome campaign because it looked very 
helpful i was just confused on how it was tied  

621
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:40,880
into animal rights i just thought they were doing 
a deed a good deed for humans at in that moment  

622
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,320
i didn't see how maybe they were maybe they were 
maybe they were maybe maybe they were only doing  

623
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,800
that some of them um but i know for sure some 
of them were also rescuing the animals i guess  

624
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,680
i mean with a more concrete example if let's 
imagine there is a concrete example of this  

625
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,800
where they're actually doing that they're actually 
advocating for animal rights whilst simultaneously  

626
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:07,760
helping humans um i guess the question is like 
would would that be something av would consider to  

627
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,960
post about if it came up or or is is there some a 
reason not to that's what i'm trying to understand  

628
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,600
like hosting this you're asking specifically 
about posting about it on social media  

629
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,800
our platforms are for animal rights for non-human 
animal rights so that's our general response to  

630
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:33,920
that but we do carry out what you're saying we 
do take the opportunity to how did you want it  

631
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,800
to benefit humans while benefiting the 
animals you know in those moments when we see  

632
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,400
any form of oppression or discrimination 
occurring within our organization  

633
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,960
we stamp it out with the quickness and we have 
a process that we go through to rid it from the  

634
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,160
organization in those moments we're taking 
action that benefits humans and the animals  

635
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:00,400
we're just not posting about it i guess because 
our platforms and network is for non-human animals  

636
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:08,320
okay i understand i understand so it's kind of 
like um yeah so your base your base kind of um  

637
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:13,760
i don't know what to put it here your 
let's say default your your focus your  

638
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,800
baseline i keep using that word is is that you 
know the the account is for non-humans and that  

639
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:25,280
that's kind of the be that's it basically that 
that's how it's going to be like social media  

640
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:31,360
and also the cubes it that that's where it's 
going to stay and that that's your core kind  

641
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:36,800
of value basically that's what you're saying here 
right yeah like again going back to the numbers  

642
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,880
thing you know three trillion animals every year 
if you think about the amount of victims that are  

643
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:47,840
involved in this injustice you know how many more 
times uh more urgent would you say in terms of the  

644
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:54,400
numbers this injustice is than other injustices 
on the planet how many more times more urgent  

645
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,200
would you say totally it's like it's not a it's 
not a criticism for me i'm actually just trying  

646
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:06,960
to uh you know clarify yeah no no maybe that was 
framed like i was like being defensive but i'm  

647
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,640
asking a genuine question because my next thing 
i was going to say because i say that to say this

648
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:24,240
like that's how much more urgent it is for us 
to maintain a focus on using those platforms  

649
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:31,680
for that reason so it's not you know okay yeah 
totally i i don't i don't see it as a a negative  

650
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,000
the reason i got into this this discussion now 
is because i i personally i i see some benefit  

651
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,520
in that for myself personally that's why i make 
some of the videos i make where i talk about  

652
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:45,200
vegans doing good work also for people i see some 
benefit in it and and that's my choice but that  

653
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:50,320
doesn't by default mean that your choice is wrong 
and i think this is um it's very important for  

654
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:54,640
anyone that watched this section and thinks oh but 
you know but some people are going to agree with  

655
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,200
you and they'll be like no keep keep the people 
off right i just just keep keep it really really  

656
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,640
focused and some people are going to agree with 
me and say well there's no harm in doing this  

657
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,600
and maybe it'll help and that's totally fine to 
have different opinions um it doesn't mean one  

658
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:12,960
of us is wrong and deserves to be cancelled and 
the others are you know deserve to be celebrated  

659
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,600
it's just you align with who you align with and if 
you're aligned with paul and asylum this then you  

660
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,440
great keep you do that for your page and 
if you align with me then great you do  

661
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,200
what i said and if you don't align with either of 
us then i don't know alive with someone else and  

662
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,600
do do that then it's it's not um this isn't a case 
of being right or wrong i just wanted to see what  

663
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:37,040
you thought about it on this specific example 
the specific topic okay cool um let's let's uh  

664
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,880
all right let's go to a more direct 
thing then because i've got a few like  

665
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:48,640
let's say more direct accusations direct uh rumors 
and um we talked about humans quite a lot now and  

666
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:53,120
actually um it's kind of shitty that i bring the 
co-founders of anonymous for the voiceless on and  

667
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:57,680
we just talk about people but um that's what we 
came here for uh maybe we can do another live  

668
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,800
stream where we actually get into the you know 
into animal rights and activism and really you  

669
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:08,160
know go for that i think that would be nice to do 
um to kind of balance having to talk about this  

670
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:15,040
for such a long time but um these 
uh main accusations we've had and  

671
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,680
this also comes in with the intersectionality and 
also comes in with the things you just discussed  

672
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:26,000
about your uh your policies um the number one 
that came up multiple times was accusations of  

673
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,600
transphobia and pronouns and you've dealt with 
this uh obviously paul you've dealt with this  

674
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:37,040
personally and you've spoken about this in other 
places but we are gonna talk about it a bit here  

675
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:43,600
and some specific questions and somebody's 
asked the question uh well i'll go for like  

676
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,360
the longer one actually there's a few questions 
but this one's actually quite a well written one  

677
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:54,800
so they said and they left av this individual 
because um because apparently av was focusing on  

678
01:07:54,800 --> 01:08:00,000
they said focusing on the animals instead of 
encouraging respect between activists uh they said  

679
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,960
that there was a situation where you guys decided 
to call people by birth names rather than calling  

680
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,440
people by their preferred pronouns and for them 
this was extremely offensive and wrong um and the  

681
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:19,359
discussion around the pronoun politics or what you 
called uh i think you call it something like uh  

682
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:24,319
identity politics um they found this to be 
a lot of people i guess found this to be  

683
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:31,840
controversial or controversial enough for them to 
leave av or at least not go to cubes anymore so  

684
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:40,160
i guess the question is um why why why is that 
why is this decision been made to not use people's  

685
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:46,320
pronouns and use their first names instead even 
if they want to be referred to by a pronoun

686
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:57,920
i guess i'll answer because there's our 
main interaction yeah uh gender pronouns  

687
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:07,840
are clearly ideological and uh we don't so 
you're just specifically asking about the cubes  

688
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:14,639
like in nab i guess yeah let's keep 
it focused on like cubes av yeah so

689
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:29,920
i've never like personally being asked to refer 
to someone as a particular like name and uh  

690
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,119
where where i've refused to call 
them that name that's never happened  

691
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:43,440
you know it's obviously the polite thing 
to do to use the requested name of someone  

692
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:48,080
but at cubes we don't even really need your name  

693
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:54,159
so it makes no sense for us to apply 
a protocol regarding one's gender  

694
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:02,160
so we don't even have a protocol regarding 
gender at all because it's not required it's  

695
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:10,560
we barely need your name at the cube and uh and 
that's what we said regarding this whole thing  

696
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:18,400
yeah so if if like putting this into real life 
like if someone actually did uh come to a cube and  

697
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:25,760
uh let's say it was it was one of your organizers 
or you whichever and they said okay i when you  

698
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,280
refer to me as like you know if if they are like 
doing something and that you're talking about them  

699
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,560
like they can't hear you or whatever or maybe 
they're in the conversation whatever they want  

700
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:40,480
to be referred to as a she um because now they're 
a trans woman and and is that something that you  

701
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,840
would respect or you would tell your organizers 
to respect or would you tell them no only refer to  

702
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:52,560
them by their name like they're his name but if if 
by respect you mean are we going to then call them  

703
01:10:53,680 --> 01:11:01,360
a man in their face in order to make a point that 
we reject the notion that they identify as a woman  

704
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,000
well of course we're not going to do that that 
that would be impolite and counterproductive for  

705
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,000
our mission on the streets to begin with which is 
to get on with non-human animal rights activism  

706
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:22,320
not get caught up in issues between humans human 
centric issues and the reason why i'm pointing out  

707
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,840
that i initially started with pointing out that  

708
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:33,600
this is clearly ideological is that we don't 
allow any other political ideologies to be  

709
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:39,840
carried out or political agendas to be carried 
out at the cubes of any kind so when we've never  

710
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:46,160
specifically targeted this in any way you 
know it's just across the board not welcome  

711
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,160
sure and what what what about in the case that 
someone doesn't actually believe or doesn't really  

712
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:57,200
agree with you that it's political because a lot 
of people who are become become a trans woman or a  

713
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:01,920
trans man they don't do it out of some political 
ideology they do it because they have gender  

714
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:08,160
dysphoria right it's a medical condition and them 
being referred to as a he or she um it's nothing  

715
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,880
to do with their politics is to do with them being 
like validated as a person right so it's actually  

716
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,960
really important i know i know there are a lot 
of trans activists out there who are making this  

717
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,600
very very political i understand that they exist 
and there are people who are not even trans who  

718
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,320
make it political by forcing others to call them 
a he or she when they've they don't have gender  

719
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,480
dysphoria you know what i mean i understand 
this is happening and i understand standing  

720
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,920
up to that but in the case where these people 
are genuine um and you know they are asking as a  

721
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:42,400
as like a you know as a courtesy to help them 
adapt to this new life for example uh would that  

722
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:47,680
be a policy of av to to tell people right you 
refer to them as they want to be referred to or  

723
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,320
is that not a policy navy and it's no you 
just you call them by name and that's it

724
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:01,200
so just to clarify here because i think there's 
some things being communicated that in this  

725
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:05,680
interaction that might lead people to think that 
we've commented on trans people when we haven't  

726
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:13,360
even commented on trans people at all ever ever 
uh my comments were only about gender pronouns  

727
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:21,360
and uh gender pronouns are a completely different 
discussion to trans issues gender pronouns  

728
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:28,160
are used by people who don't even identify as 
trans so i'm not talking about trans people i've  

729
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:32,880
never talked i've never said anything about trans 
people and neither is a cell and that needs to be  

730
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:39,200
clarified 100 i think because i don't appreciate 
getting tossed into that category of someone who  

731
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:44,560
has spoken about trans people when i haven't said 
a single word about trans people uh my comments  

732
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:50,400
are about my skepticism towards gender pronouns 
and the use of gender pronouns and then being  

733
01:13:50,400 --> 01:14:00,800
50 plus gender pronouns that was my comment and uh 
this like i said at the cube there's no real need  

734
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:08,960
for even even for someone's name so if if this is 
happening this interaction is happening at a cube  

735
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,840
where someone is offended because you 
haven't used their correct gender pronoun  

736
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,720
that's what i mean by becoming political 
and someone bringing a political agenda into  

737
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:25,600
that space when we don't even really require 
your name so if that discussion is occurring  

738
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:31,360
at the cube it's likely because someone is 
choosing to make a rise out of it and you know to  

739
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:40,720
uh to you know obviously if someone is like i 
said already going out of their way to disrespect  

740
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:45,440
somebody like this yes we would take issue 
with that 100 we would see that as bullying  

741
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:51,600
it would be implied and it would be bullying 
to say no i don't not only do i not believe  

742
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:58,560
what you believe but your belief is stupid that's 
bullying right so of course we don't condone that  

743
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:05,760
but at the same time forcing others to believe 
what you believe at the cube is not welcome  

744
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:12,400
that's not what we're there for right everybody 
has a different belief system when it comes  

745
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,720
to this topic and people are entitled 
to have different opinions about this  

746
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:25,040
and that's it's not a time and a space at a cube 
of truth to be fighting each other to be engaging  

747
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:31,040
in this kind of discord when it's human-centric 
and we are supposed to be there for non-human  

748
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:35,440
animals we should be respecting each other 
to have the right to have a different opinion  

749
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,280
and to just get on with the one thing we're 
supposed to be on the same page about which is  

750
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:45,680
non-human animal rights deserve to have this three 
or four hours dedicated to them on the streets  

751
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:52,400
yeah i guess i guess to kind of close this 
off or i hope we can close it off as if  

752
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,840
so if if uh we have i mean obviously there 
are there are obviously trans activists right  

753
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,920
i'm focusing on trans here because i understand 
what you're saying about gender pronouns in that  

754
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,880
if somebody has chosen a pronoun because it's 
whatever it's something they want to identify as  

755
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,840
i understand why there's some some skepticism here 
because it's kind of like all right that's fine  

756
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,600
you'll go ahead and do that and people can 
respect that but if if they forget or if they  

757
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,280
i don't know if they don't want to and there's 
no real logic behind the reason that the view  

758
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,880
identifying is that i can understand why 
someone you know not being into that but  

759
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,360
where i'm specifically focusing on here and 
and i'm focusing on it because it is it is  

760
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,040
medical it is it is it is a psychological 
thing it is not something that's like  

761
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:39,200
opinion is that you know gender dysphoria 
exists like trans people exist we have to

762
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,440
time but now it's becoming more acceptable to 
discuss it right so you see a lot more people  

763
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,040
who are coming out this way whereas in the past 
they wouldn't have done they would have hidden  

764
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,480
it because they were embarrassed or ashamed and 
they just go through their whole life with this  

765
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,360
situation you know with this this problem nowadays 
uh people are being encouraged to speak up about  

766
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:04,320
it and you know go public and get the operation 
and and re-identify themselves so that they're  

767
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:11,040
more they are who they are right what i'm trying 
to get here is that does does av have like uh  

768
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:16,560
something in place that is also accommodating that 
so that so that if somebody does come to a cube as  

769
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:24,320
a trans person um and they want to be identified 
as a he um or she or they if they're not sure um  

770
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:29,760
and somebody is is you know if they get it wrong 
by accident okay i get that that's something that  

771
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,000
you know it shouldn't if it's a complaint you 
just say okay hey please you know don't don't  

772
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,080
get it wrong by accident in the future like do us 
a favor but if if they're choosing to get it wrong  

773
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:44,960
if they're like actually saying no i don't accept 
that are you saying that yeah bullying yeah that  

774
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,440
could that could be bullying yeah um but also i 
kind of i'm kind of trying to understand where  

775
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:54,240
the line's drawn between well that's your 
ideology so tough [ __ ] versus well okay no  

776
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:58,640
this is something that this is you this is who 
you are and look this person needs to respect  

777
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,080
that or or they're the one that'll be kicked 
out like where are you where are you drawing  

778
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:07,280
the line between the ideology versus the bullying 
if you understand what i'm saying because maybe  

779
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,840
an organizer says well i don't need to respect 
that because i don't agree where's the line drawn

780
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:21,600
the line is simply drawn at if the interaction 
at the cube requires your gender then okay we'll  

781
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,840
use whatever gender you choose us to use however 
whatever name because in that case they can also  

782
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,440
use the name if the organizer or the volunteer 
feels uncomfortable or they don't align with the  

783
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:38,400
same ideologies they don't have to use the pronoun 
they can just refer to them with their chosen name  

784
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,320
yeah that's what i was going to say is that the 
interactions that you don't actually require  

785
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:50,400
don't actually require the gender so that's what i 
was saying is that if i'm trying to be charitable  

786
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:54,720
and open-minded here by saying if there is 
a circumstance of the cube that requires the  

787
01:18:54,720 --> 01:19:00,960
gender and the interaction to be successful in 
the communication sure no not using that would  

788
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,320
be rude it would be bullying and when there's 
no case at a cube of truth never within ab  

789
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,480
where this has happened where we've bullied 
people and said [ __ ] your beliefs that's  

790
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,080
never happened it's just ridiculous to even 
suggest that that has happened but you know  

791
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:22,480
but it's not required that's what we're saying 
it's not required it's it's yeah this this notion  

792
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:29,440
that it is required is a new notion that's being 
brought into a b it's never been required and um i  

793
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:37,440
i think i know something that was brought up a 
while ago was um people are suggesting that at the  

794
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:45,440
start of the cube because we do a briefing right 
when everyone's there getting ready to do the cube  

795
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:51,600
somebody or maybe a few people suggested that 
we do this like we go around and get people to  

796
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:58,960
introduce themselves and choose their preferred 
like announce their preferred pronoun and this  

797
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,480
is something that brought was brought up to us 
and that was our response because something like  

798
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:12,160
that 100 takes away from what we're doing because 
it's not necessary and it's irrelevant so to put  

799
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:18,400
time aside 15 20 minutes for everyone to go around 
and say my name is blah blah blah and this is my  

800
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:25,120
preferred pronoun which is unnecessary because in 
case we need to refer to you you let us know then  

801
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:30,800
if we got it wrong you correct us that's fine we 
can get on with our day um i know that that was  

802
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:36,000
something that was brought up and i just wanted to 
clarify that there are many other things that are  

803
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:49,360
human-centric that we don't allocate our activism 
our time to at the cubes to engaging in and so you  

804
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:57,200
could use this same logic if you're claiming that 
we are discriminatory towards those who have uh  

805
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,800
again we've never even spoken about trans 
people so i reject the notion of even  

806
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:09,600
commenting on trans people people with gender 
pronouns uh the same argument could be used  

807
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:17,120
for uh not um honoring the custodians of the 
land and saying something about like the original  

808
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:22,960
custodians the land the aboriginals or or the 
native americans depending on the of the region  

809
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,520
that we're talking about here we don't do that at 
the cubes either does that mean that we are also  

810
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:34,560
racist or we're also colonial colonialists 
or whatever the word is that's being tossed  

811
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:40,160
around regarding that discrimination no of 
course not because we're there for non-humans  

812
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:44,080
and non-humans deserve a cause dedicated 
to them that's what this comes down to  

813
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:50,800
is if you think that we're being discriminatory 
under that logic then you really just don't think  

814
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:57,440
that animals deserve a cause solely dedicated to 
them that's what we're disagreeing about yeah yeah  

815
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:02,800
i guess i guess my my what i'm what i was trying 
to get out of it here is try to get to clarify  

816
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:08,320
what for 100 this which i think you have clarified 
now is that like the the you know what you don't  

817
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:15,680
want people you don't want to bring up um like 
let's say identity politics into into cubing  

818
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:21,120
you don't want it to become part of av you don't 
want it to become part of an action or an event  

819
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:28,160
um however if somebody has personal a personal 
thing where they want to be referred to as  

820
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:34,160
a certain pronoun or they've recently transitioned 
that av is part of av policies to respect that  

821
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,320
because not respecting that would be considered 
bullying that's what i'm trying to clarify here  

822
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:43,120
so this is you're making a distinction between the 
two i also need to make the distinction here that  

823
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:50,480
we're referring to sex if anything whenever the 
word gender is being used in this conversation  

824
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:56,240
we are not referring to anything other than 
sex we are not referring our repeat to anything  

825
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:05,360
other than sex and the conversation keeps getting 
skewed by others to be referring to gender but uh  

826
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:12,160
regarding trans issues or regarding this 
whole thing uh with my comments on being  

827
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:17,920
skeptical of gender pronouns it was regarding 
sex that i was skeptical of this there aren't  

828
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:22,880
more than two sexes in my opinion and i think 
that people are entitled to have that opinion  

829
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,360
trans people are transitioning between those 
two sexes i think they have the right to do that  

830
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:33,200
so i support the trans movement if that's what it 
is right i have trans people that follow me that  

831
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:40,160
support me that like me in the face of my comments 
and the hate i receive getting called a transfer  

832
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:45,120
does not waver these people i'm not trying to use 
them as a token i'm just giving people context  

833
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:54,000
because context is lost in our in our culture 
and yeah that's all i have to say okay um

834
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:01,600
yeah yes i'm trying to wrap my head around it 
and also i just sorry i was just taking care of  

835
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,600
a troll as well i'm just asking annie to get rid 
of a troll in the chat as i was also trying to get  

836
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:12,000
that sword it seems like they're bothering people 
so you obviously you make a separation between um  

837
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:17,840
sex and gender which i think most well i mean 
that's just that's that's scientific um there  

838
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:23,120
is there is actually i think um some people would 
argue including myself that there are three sexes  

839
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,160
because there's intersex which is very rare but 
it exists right it's it's when someone's born with  

840
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:33,600
both or like like you know both um genetics or 
whatever i don't know too much about it but i  

841
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,560
know that it exists um and then yeah and then and 
then you're drawing the line because because um  

842
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:45,360
yeah because genders it's a new it is an ideology 
the ideology gender ideology is new it is new  

843
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:49,440
if anyone's upset about this then i'm not sorry 
because you need to do some research on this and  

844
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:55,760
how realize how gender ideology is a very recent 
thing and it hasn't been put through the rigorous  

845
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:01,840
testing that most other psychological and science 
scientific you know concepts have you know about  

846
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:08,320
humans have been through so it's not something 
that should be accepted um just because it's big  

847
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:13,680
and because it's being pushed but at the same time 
for good or for bad there are people out there who  

848
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,320
uh yeah like specifically it is it is very much 
intertwined with trends with the trans issues  

849
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,680
which is why it keeps coming up and this you 
didn't you said earlier i don't understand why  

850
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,760
people keep saying it's about trans it's because 
i feel i feel personally i don't tell me if i'm  

851
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:34,720
wrong i feel like that that um i wouldn't say 
popularity but the the more exposure let's say  

852
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:40,400
the more awareness of trends and what it means 
to be trans has also come tied in with gender  

853
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:47,520
and and gender identity yeah because yeah confuse 
the issue though i think deliberately they have to  

854
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:53,280
use the two now it's like all mixed in but 
it doesn't need to be because when we're  

855
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:58,640
talking about gender pronouns and gender 
we're talking about gender roles and like  

856
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:04,640
you can you can be a female like you can be 
born a female in a female body but you may  

857
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:13,360
not necessarily feel like you are fitting into 
that you know that i don't know mindset or that  

858
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,080
gender role and that's totally fine but that's 
not what we're talking about when we're talking  

859
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:23,040
about like someone transitioning you're talking 
about them changing their their body and that's  

860
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:28,880
the sex it's like when you go to the doctor they 
they care about knowing your birth sex because  

861
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,400
you know the doctor needs about your body and your 
biology so that's why sex and gender are different  

862
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:40,320
and if anyone wants to confuse the two that's 
just not gonna you know that's fine but that's  

863
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:48,720
that's just not the reality of it they're they're 
completely separate uh and my trans um supporters  

864
01:26:48,720 --> 01:27:00,720
tell me this and and i agree with them convoluting 
conflating gender politics uh the gender pronoun

865
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:10,640
issue in society that's been brought up uh with 
the trans movement and struggle of trans people  

866
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:17,040
is actually diminishing them as victims of their 
struggle so it takes away from what they're really  

867
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:21,440
dealing with and uh they're not struggling 
with gender pronouns necessarily like the  

868
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,880
the struggles are different 
they're they're struggling  

869
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:30,640
with uh with just being accepted as a trans 
person and that's a different discussion  

870
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:36,000
completely to what we're discussing here this is 
what they tell me and i agree with them and uh  

871
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:44,640
it's disrespectful to the trans movement to just 
attach all these other things to it and say that's  

872
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:52,400
a trans issue too yeah if you care about the trans 
movement then you wouldn't do that i understand so  

873
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:59,920
yeah there's a distinction between just wanting 
to identify as one of the limitless genders and  

874
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:05,520
actually suffering from gender dysphoria and and 
changing your sex and wanting to be referred to  

875
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:11,040
as a different pronoun because it it validates who 
you are and it's something that you have struggled  

876
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:15,600
through yes you're drawing there's a distinction 
between the two basically is what you're saying  

877
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:21,440
right there absolutely is and trans people 
around the world feel diminished because of this  

878
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:30,400
this incessant um obsessive need to link it to 
everything else and they've already finished on  

879
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:38,560
top okay but it's but although although you hold 
this belief and obviously av operates on this um  

880
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:44,000
not belief i wouldn't say but let's say opinion 
and the av operates also on this opinion like that  

881
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:50,640
av will not accept um people bringing 
in ideologies um without let's say  

882
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:55,840
like obviously trans trend the trans movement 
isn't an ideology um not for them not for the  

883
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:00,640
people who are actually uh you know suffering from 
gender dysphoria anyway although there are people  

884
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,640
who are calling themselves trans who are actually 
not don't have gender dysphoria then that's an  

885
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:09,680
ideology i would say that's different that's a 
political um ideology or or some i don't know  

886
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:16,720
ideology of some sort um but unfortunately i would 
say it is it is difficult to actually determine  

887
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:22,480
who is who right and and who is for real and who 
is doing this because they genuinely you know are  

888
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:27,200
a trans person and who is doing this because they 
have they want to get on board with an ideology  

889
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:34,160
and and kind of i don't know be different um i 
guess how does av how does it how is av going  

890
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:39,680
to operate with that because i know that you like 
you've just said you'll you accept people who have  

891
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:44,560
uh and you accept and will respect people 
who are genuinely you know are trans or or  

892
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:48,720
whatever if they have whatever condition the av 
will respect them and people will be booted if  

893
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:53,680
they don't respect them but then also in the same 
breath you're saying that the political ideology  

894
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:58,400
is not actually welcome and so if somebody isn't 
actually trans and they are just identifying as  

895
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:03,760
someone else because it's something they want 
to do so how is av going to actually how would  

896
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,240
you operate with these two individuals let's say 
being around how are you going to determine who  

897
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:13,360
who should be respected and and you know should 
be dealt with in a very in a respectful way  

898
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,200
and who should actually be told no don't 
bring your ideologies here leave it at home  

899
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:27,360
well everyone everyone everyone needs to be 
respected okay everyone including yeah that's  

900
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:36,560
the answer everyone needs to be respected so i 
mean uh everyone is entitled to their opinions  

901
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:44,720
but no one is entitled to use their to weaponize 
their opinions against others and that's my  

902
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:52,080
most accurate answer to that okay sure everyone 
is respected for their opinions and their right to  

903
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:58,320
have an opinion no one has a right to weaponize 
their opinion against others in any way and so

904
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,360
that's it i mean you know where do we draw 
the line with human stuff as well because  

905
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:09,680
we allow people who are disabled to come 
to our cubes and rock a wheelchair in the  

906
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:16,880
cube we've had so many people in wheelchairs 
in our cubes around the world we don't say

907
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:24,720
we don't you know we welcome these people i don't 
know why i'm using that as a point i guess it's  

908
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:31,600
just of course we welcome different uh struggles 
and we accommodate different struggles within nav  

909
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:37,280
but only as far as getting the job done is 
required because we're there for the animals and  

910
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:41,840
that just needs to be respected 
also everyone needs to be respected  

911
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,400
for the mission when we're at the cube but 
i think we should move on now to the next  

912
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:51,120
subject all right all right okay can 
i close off of the bottom line and  

913
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,160
bottom line yes or no question and then 
we'll move on is that all right with you  

914
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,720
but it's bottom line yes or no then so what 
i'm understanding is that someone comes to the  

915
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:07,680
cube they request to be called a certain thing 
and people in the cubes people the organizers  

916
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:14,400
are requested to respect that and if they get it 
wrong by accident no worries don't do it again  

917
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:18,960
if you get it wrong on purpose you're being 
disrespectful and you'll be you'll be if it  

918
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:24,480
comes up you will be told either told off or or i 
don't know warned and saying that that's bullying  

919
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:28,640
am i right is that correct is that if i understood 
this correctly or is there something i've missed

920
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:43,840
um sorry i sorry i just kind of zoned out for a 
bit so you said right somebody got it wrong by  

921
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:50,960
accident no worries obviously what are we gonna 
do um and then if they did it on purpose they're  

922
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,920
gonna get kicked out is that always not kicked 
out whatever it may be they'd be either warned  

923
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,840
or if it's been multiple times let's say you 
would you you would take a further action if  

924
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,160
it's if it's becoming a habit you know if it's 
something they've done more than once for example  

925
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:11,680
yeah um yeah basically but like what i was saying 
earlier if somebody feels that strongly about  

926
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:17,040
it that they're not willing to because they 
feel like they're accepting that ideology  

927
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:22,320
by referring to um say you showed up at a 
cube and you want to be referred to as she  

928
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:30,240
and like i just can't accept that then in that 
case they could refer to you with your name  

929
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:36,160
and if they're not willing to do that then yes 
that would be an issue because then that person  

930
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:41,680
buying this thing on not wanting to refer to 
you as whatever then that that person is taking  

931
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:46,320
away from the event in the queue because they're 
good yeah they're making good about anything else  

932
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:53,040
yeah they make yeah okay but i think that yeah 
that seems reasonable to me but i'm i'm i guess  

933
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,880
it's not good enough for everyone for a lot of 
people but i i feel like it's reasonable i just  

934
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:02,240
wanted to clarify it before we moved on though 
yeah when we move on i just want to say one more  

935
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:08,800
time like this has literally never happened in 
our personal experience has never happened and i  

936
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:16,320
haven't heard of a specific um event where this 
was the issue and this this was brought up and  

937
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:23,120
somebody you know had an issue with referring to 
someone else with their preferred name or pronouns  

938
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:29,920
i just want to say how uncommon this is but yeah 
i guess it's just about future proofing because  

939
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:35,200
this is the world we're in um now you know uh 
it's it's i don't think it's a bad world that  

940
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:40,720
we're in i think it's good i think uh that's why 
i wanted to really get into it because i i am 100  

941
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:44,640
certain that as as we go into the future this 
is going to become more and more and more common  

942
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:49,680
and not just in av in other organizations 
like you know jobs like people working in  

943
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:52,960
offices and stuff like that this is going to 
start becoming more and more common because  

944
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:59,360
people you know in general people don't like 
change um in general uh so you're gonna have to i  

945
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,720
think we i feel we hope we all have to expect that 
we're gonna be some people out there who are gonna  

946
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:08,080
cause problems on both sides of this you know not 
only on the people rejecting the idea side but  

947
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:13,280
also the people demanding they be referred to as 
a certain thing it's gonna oh it's only going to  

948
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:18,080
become more prevalent i guess that's why i feel 
like it's an important topic to get into well  

949
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:24,400
again like you know yeah just cap this off with a 
black and white answer and then sure you know it's  

950
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:30,880
it works the other way as well like no bullying 
will be allowed but also if you're bullying others  

951
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,560
to believe what you believe at the cube that's not 
a lot either if you're not required to hand it to  

952
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:42,080
to give us your gender in that interaction and 
you're forcing it anyways that's an issue yeah  

953
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:48,240
that's a problem because that's not that's not 
productive communication and uh and teamwork  

954
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:52,640
when the goal is supposed to be non-human 
animal rights yeah it goes both ways yeah  

955
01:35:54,560 --> 01:36:01,760
sure just but basically just just respect each 
other it's the bottom line earlier the answer to  

956
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:07,280
it is everyone will be respected 
that's the rule all right got it  

957
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:14,880
all right cool cool let's uh we're going from 
one to another i guess uh in terms of this i  

958
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,240
think these might be a little bit easier to 
get into though because there's just some  

959
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:23,360
there's a few more like more direct accusations 
that came through however they didn't really come  

960
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:28,240
through with any kind of backing but i wanted 
to put them to you as like a topic of like why  

961
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:32,240
do you think people are saying this right and you 
can tell me why you think people are saying this  

962
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:37,680
so there's been accusations of of of racism 
as well against av as an organization and also  

963
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:41,680
i'm sorry paul but it tends to be coming at 
you most of the time um with these things the  

964
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:47,760
sal seems to get off the hook um but um this 
racism apparently av is racist and apparently  

965
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:53,840
paul is racist and i think some of this did 
come from the the blm post um but that was  

966
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,760
an av thing that wasn't necessarily a poll 
thing why why do you think people are coming  

967
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:03,600
at you and and making accusations that you 
are a racist individually paul or not av  

968
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,440
we'll deal with av in a second but why do you 
think it's coming for you that people say this

969
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:15,520
who isn't called a racist in 2020

970
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:21,760
i'm suss on anyone not being 
called a racist in 2020  

971
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:30,960
uh why is i mean i'm answering quantum physics in 
that question i don't know the answer it's like  

972
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:39,360
uh yeah i don't know why why humans 
the way they are i i just i really  

973
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:46,080
i don't know it's uh i i actually haven't ever 
heard anyone directly call me a racist because  

974
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:51,600
of the blm poet like me personally yeah no no 
that's that's like an av thing i think it's  

975
01:37:51,600 --> 01:38:01,840
a general thing yeah i mean we have been called 
a racist both of us not over that post though but  

976
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:10,560
yeah i don't know why i'm not sure why actually 
i'd like to see evidence your honor the evidence  

977
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:17,200
please yeah i think there was there was there was 
a post i'm just remembering now i think that it  

978
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:20,880
could have i don't know contributed to it i 
think where you would you were talking to a  

979
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,840
you were outreaching a black guy and you said some 
things about you know you defended the animals  

980
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:31,200
um and i think some people found it to be 
somehow racist because of the words you used  

981
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:36,960
and do you remember that at all like yes black 
guy was a black girl so you misgendered her  

982
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,400
you should really be ashamed of 
yourself let's cancel david immediately

983
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:47,360
trust me trust me out of this video this is not 
going to be the thing that gets taken there's  

984
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:50,560
things we've said already that 
i've as they came out of my mouth  

985
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,200
i was like yeah that's going to be that's 
going to be screenshotted that's going to  

986
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:58,240
be all over the place soon so no don't worry 
we're already that boat was sailed we're done  

987
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:07,920
um so if you watch the video guys she was 
making a point to me that she doesn't need  

988
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:13,200
to take animal rights seriously especially 
even if she is the oppressor in this scenario  

989
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:21,440
as a non-vegan because black people are oppressed 
that was her argument that she put to me  

990
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:28,080
and she even said something to the effect that 
speciesism doesn't apply to me and my people and  

991
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:34,960
i said it applies to anybody who oppresses animals 
who isn't vegan uh she carried on and i felt it  

992
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:41,760
was only right to make the point that animals are 
the most oppressed group of beings on the planet  

993
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:50,960
it felt to me the most appropriate thing to say at 
that time because i speak on behalf of the animals  

994
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,080
if i was in their position that's 
exactly what i would want to be  

995
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,440
said in that moment so that that 
person had the correct perspective

996
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:11,280
uh whether they accept the truth is not my uh i 
don't i don't have any uh skin in that game my  

997
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:16,480
mission is to tell the truth on behalf of the 
victims because it's the least that we can do so  

998
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:23,840
that's what i said and that was that was uh what 
people have called me racist over so that was like  

999
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:28,960
i mean it's let's let's let's be like that's not [ 
__ ] here it's definitely something that would be  

1000
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:35,920
considered to be like insensitive but but that's 
not your the goal isn't to be sensitive um a lot  

1001
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,000
you know it's i don't think being insensitive is 
necessarily something negative i think sometimes  

1002
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:45,920
it needs to be um like that but but how is that 
translating to racism like if somebody said paul  

1003
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,080
you're [ __ ] insensitive i i wouldn't i don't 
think i'd even bring that up because it's like  

1004
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:54,320
well yeah that's obvious like you you 
know your outreach videos tend to be  

1005
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:00,240
towards the side of insensitivity and more towards 
the side of like straight direct like you're going  

1006
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:03,840
to get the message whether it pisses you off or 
not right if you're being sensitive you would  

1007
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,240
dress it up and be nice but you're not being and 
that's not something to criticize in my opinion  

1008
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:12,800
or it is whatever but that's not the point here 
the point is racism so how does that translate to  

1009
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:18,320
racism how do you think someone gets it from 
that video that that's you somehow you know  

1010
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:24,560
disrespecting somebody because of their ethnicity 
just because of her skin color right well no no  

1011
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:30,640
again no it's not just well it's not just that you 
are speaking to a white woman would would you get  

1012
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:36,880
no of course not but it's not just that it's 
also the fact what people are overlooking here  

1013
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:42,400
is if if we are going to entertain the notion 
that there is insensitivity at play here  

1014
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:47,200
people are overlooking the fact that she 
was being incredibly insensitive to the  

1015
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:52,720
animal victims that she is an oppressor of 
directly responsible for victimizing herself  

1016
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:59,840
and so that's where it started that's where the 
context of all of this began i was responding  

1017
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:06,720
to her not by saying [ __ ] black people and [ __ 
] black rights but by saying animals are the most  

1018
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:13,280
oppressed group of beings on the planet if me 
pointing out a fact is insensitive while she's  

1019
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:21,120
literally saying [ __ ] the animals and [ __ ] 
their rights well i guess you need to ask yourself  

1020
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:28,160
which like what does it take for you to see 
injustice for what it is especially when it's  

1021
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:34,160
to the degree that it is he in this case with the 
animals when they're subjected to the most brutal  

1022
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:40,080
violence that has ever been carried out on any 
group of beings ever what does it take for people  

1023
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:49,120
to to to just literally just acknowledge them and 
to acknowledge the fact that they are subjected  

1024
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:53,840
to oppression to the extent that they 
are subjected to that oppression and for  

1025
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:59,040
simply just simply for people to simply say 
that for people to simply speak about that  

1026
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:06,640
if that's offensive we have no hope as a species 
evolving and developing into better ways of  

1027
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:14,080
of living on this planet and uh with truly 
addressing injustice and oppression on this  

1028
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:18,560
planet it's never going to happen unless we 
change the way we think around things like this  

1029
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:27,280
yeah i i i think honestly my opinion on 
this is like to to label that as racism  

1030
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:35,040
is is offensive um to it's offensive because 
it's not even offensive it's it's harmful  

1031
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:42,400
because it confuses what actual racism is right 
how how can you call like and this is this  

1032
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:46,160
when you really lay it out like this 
right you've got two people of color  

1033
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:50,000
you're not white so two people of color 
having a conversation about the animals  

1034
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:56,320
and one of the people says that you know the 
reality about the animals and somehow that  

1035
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:03,520
person is racist it's just such a strange thing to 
call racism over and it completely takes away the  

1036
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,760
meaning of the word and i've said this before 
people get really upset about it that the more  

1037
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:14,080
you use the word racist sexist transphobe the more 
difficult it becomes to actually identify racists  

1038
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:19,680
sexists and transphobes and and i think nowadays 
we're in a position where it's like you said who  

1039
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:26,480
hasn't been called a racist um or a transphobe or 
a sexist in 2020 practically anyone who has dared  

1040
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:31,600
to even question the narrative has been called 
one of those things it's either you you do what  

1041
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:36,000
you're told and you say what you're supposed 
to say or that's what you get branded with  

1042
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,520
do you know how harmful that is to the people who 
actually suffer from sexism racism and transphobia  

1043
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:48,720
the fact that you know that label is so used so 
flippantly if you could you could say that for  

1044
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:58,080
every every other label that is thrown around 
um to to to to try and cancel others when uh  

1045
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:08,320
when faceless whether it's the term fascist 
or or sexist or racist or or whatever it is  

1046
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:14,080
it takes these people are supposed to care about 
these injustices when they're literally spinning  

1047
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:22,720
in the faces of the victims that are subjected 
by those injustices when they do that definitely  

1048
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:31,120
and move it on to the av racism claim the blm 
post that was the uh the center of apparent  

1049
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:38,320
uh racism you know this is the uh apparently that 
post was in itself racist and and those it's gone  

1050
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:42,880
now obviously but for those who didn't see it it 
was the image the famous image that went around  

1051
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:49,600
of a blm activist a black man holding a pig's 
head by the ears a severed pig's head by the ears  

1052
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:58,160
to protest against police brutality a navy av put 
out a an image with the caption and that was it  

1053
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:02,800
ended up causing so much controversy and claims 
of racism and all these things and it and it was  

1054
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:07,520
removed in the end right so like tell us the i 
know you've done it before again i'm sorry you  

1055
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,200
have to keep repeating yourself but you know we 
are we're aiming to get through everything today  

1056
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:16,960
but tell us the story behind that then and and you 
know if you think that was racist as well and the  

1057
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:26,880
reasons you removed it so it wasn't removed um 
it wasn't removed you know as a result of like

1058
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:36,960
so just to clarify it's still up on our instagram 
it's only been removed on facebook because  

1059
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:44,240
we stupidly took i want to say take the bet we 
took the bait i don't know if that's the proper  

1060
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:50,800
term to use here but whatever with regards to 
what the donor was demanding of us at the time  

1061
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:58,160
throughout the whole debacle that we went through 
with the donor and uh so we made a decision  

1062
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:08,880
to remove that post only because this 
donor was learning to remove our funding um  

1063
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:15,120
and it was it was the only thing that 
we were willing to consider doing  

1064
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:22,240
uh out of all the demands that they gave 
us we completely rejected the notion of  

1065
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:28,960
a board of directors and the other things we we 
really push back on and we we try to be as as  

1066
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:35,840
charitable and open to these demands as possible 
which is why we deleted that post as a decision  

1067
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:43,280
we made and at this point we had deleted it 
probably a month and a half or two months  

1068
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:50,480
after the post was made so at that point it had 
it had seen most of its traction you know so  

1069
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:57,840
uh i just want to clarify it wasn't removed 
after getting heat from people in the comments  

1070
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:05,760
section or anything like that it was uh it 
was a post that we believe needs to happen  

1071
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:10,720
it's just the way that we communicated in 
that post that we felt we could improve  

1072
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:15,360
on and we have already addressed this within 
the organization because recently we saw the  

1073
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:20,640
same thing happening at another protest 
in spain and we made a post about that uh

1074
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:30,400
it didn't you know it didn't get as much traction 
but um you know so there's something to be said  

1075
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:34,400
about being direct about these things but 
it's unpopular we share a lot of unpopular  

1076
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:38,720
opinions that's what we do because the 
truth is unpopular at the best of times  

1077
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:48,480
uh and yeah and uh we are committed to speak up 
against animal oppression wherever we see it so  

1078
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:54,160
if it's been if it's being paraded on the 
on the main stage on in the mainstream on  

1079
01:48:54,160 --> 01:49:02,400
the news every around the world as a appropriate 
and acceptable way of addressing human um centric  

1080
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:09,920
injustices you know to hold decapitated heads 
up to to say [ __ ] the police uh then we have  

1081
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:16,160
a responsibility to say something about that 
um no oppression is acceptable ever no one  

1082
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:21,840
has the right to oppress anyone else ever in any 
situation ever and uh and that's supposed to be  

1083
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:27,680
the ethos behind these protests that were 
occurring this year and that's our ethos so  

1084
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:33,680
we should be seeing eye to eye but uh yeah that's 
really our responsibility to do that but yeah we  

1085
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:39,040
remove that post um as a result of the donor and 
we we regret that decision i don't know how else  

1086
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:43,760
to say it but it's i mean we we still have it on 
instagram it's not being removed from instagram so  

1087
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:52,000
from that what you will sure sure so that's yeah 
it clarifies a lot and and just to clarify here  

1088
01:49:52,000 --> 01:50:00,160
like you don't you don't believe that post was 
racist right no like what we said it could have  

1089
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:06,960
been communicated better um and that's why before 
we removed it we actually went in and edited the  

1090
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:13,120
post a little bit so we changed the wording 
in certain parts um so that there was more  

1091
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:21,840
empathy or you know it didn't come across as 
insensitive like you said but absolutely no  

1092
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:28,480
it wasn't yes so i think i think that's that's a 
a wider issue really isn't it insensitivity versus  

1093
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:35,680
uh versus racism or or whatever ism you want to 
attach it's uh it's not bigoted to be insensitive  

1094
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:43,120
um it's some people are i don't know harsher than 
others and i think um on a personal level i think  

1095
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:48,320
i think that's where a lot of the criticisms and 
accusations come from with av i don't think it's  

1096
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:54,800
uh i think it is that our movement is quite a 
sensitive movement with very sensitive people and  

1097
01:50:55,360 --> 01:51:01,200
av isn't isn't very sensitive and that's that's 
not i don't mean that as a criticism at all i mean  

1098
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:05,840
that as in some people don't like that and that's 
that's you know that's where we get a lot of  

1099
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:10,320
a lot of people who come up and speak up about 
it whereas if you look at an organization like  

1100
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:15,120
save for example they're the complete opposite 
side they're extremely sensitive and so they  

1101
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:20,400
attract a lot of people who are uh you know also 
extremely sensitive which happens to be the vast  

1102
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:27,280
majority of of the animal rights movement and the 
vegan movement people tend to be very sensitive  

1103
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:32,320
in these groups so you know i can see i can see 
where the accusations come flying in from but um  

1104
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:38,160
i think if they were accusing you of insensitivity 
and and being too mean i think that would  

1105
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:44,720
probably be not as nowhere near as harmful as 
throwing the word racist at every turn you know  

1106
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:49,120
that's my observation anyway that's 
what i'm observing from the outside  

1107
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,480
and this kind of track this this continues 
really with the social media people have  

1108
01:51:54,480 --> 01:51:58,320
been upset by your social media quite a lot and i 
know some of these examples are going to be very  

1109
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:03,760
easy to discuss but we'll start off with the most 
difficult one just to uh kick it off with this um  

1110
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:10,480
i want to discuss the whole uh the whole hitler 
thing and george because a few people asked me  

1111
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:14,880
about this they asked me about george they asked 
me about this post this this uh which obviously  

1112
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:20,160
i know you removed it um but they kind of 
want to know how it got to the point where  

1113
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:24,720
someone in the organization would think about 
making a post a comment like that and kind of  

1114
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:30,880
what you guys think about it so if again for those 
who don't know there was the um there was a post  

1115
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:36,000
made i believe it was it was avs page as well 
wasn't it on facebook it was a comment um where  

1116
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:42,080
the comment was talking about hitler and it was 
comparing hitler and the it was saying basically  

1117
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:46,720
out of context here by the way completely out 
of context and i've not got the screenshot so  

1118
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:51,200
i'm not going to put it up but out of context 
it was making a comparison and saying that the  

1119
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:59,760
holocaust that hitler did had more justification 
than the holocaust of the animals i'm paraphrasing  

1120
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,760
here it was put into a better context than 
that but that's that was the takeaway message  

1121
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:08,720
that it was it had more justification because a 
book was written about it practically or have i  

1122
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:13,120
missed a big point there but either way that 
seemed to be the takeaway point from it um  

1123
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:19,200
out of context and that was obviously posted by i 
believe george in the in the organization on as av  

1124
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:24,160
so like what happened with this have i got 
that wrong have people got that wrong and yeah

1125
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:31,040
he's not saying that he wasn't saying 
like legitimate justifications were  

1126
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:39,840
were afoot in those cases he was saying that more 
reasons were provided by hitler and his regime  

1127
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:46,480
to the public then then the re then then what 
non-vegans offer to the public regarding the  

1128
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:51,920
injustice that they're involved in that's what he 
was saying but the way that he said it lacked eq  

1129
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:58,240
you got to have iq george is a smart guy but you 
got to have eq2 you got to read the room and not  

1130
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:03,360
be an idiot about how you communicate emotionally 
uh so that's the thing it wasn't clear enough  

1131
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:06,880
the communication we identified as something 
that needs to be improved and that's why we  

1132
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:16,320
addressed the whole blm post to begin with uh the 
way that we did it was about the communication  

1133
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:21,440
and we still feel justified in 
addressing what we addressed  

1134
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:30,800
and we will continue to do so but um i think 
you know sometimes yeah the issue there was um  

1135
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:39,680
sometimes there is bias that's brought into 
the work that people are doing within ab  

1136
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:46,640
they bring their own biases whether they're 
political or otherwise in the way they communicate  

1137
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:52,000
and people need to remember if they're working 
with av they're representing ap just like  

1138
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:57,680
with any other org or group that they're 
working with and when you're representing us

1139
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:05,520
we don't want that and you know he also 
did admit to doing this himself um so  

1140
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:13,360
it's not just an opinion that we had this was 
really happening and uh that was the issue that  

1141
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:20,400
you're pointing out david sure and and george and 
another individual they were removed from the team  

1142
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:24,640
was was that because of this specific example or 
was there another reason that these individuals  

1143
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:31,040
were removed there was another question somebody 
asked that was one of the comments but there were  

1144
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:39,280
other comments left um by george but also it was 
the conversations we had in private with them  

1145
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:45,840
about the issue i believe the comments were 
about um denying that systemic oppression exists  

1146
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:55,680
and how that comment was left by our social media 
members without them running it by us and that's  

1147
01:55:55,680 --> 01:56:04,640
not something that um just didn't align with us 
or av or other team members so that's why we had  

1148
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:10,400
to have private conversations to clarify this and 
that and during those conversations we realized  

1149
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:16,000
that we're just not aligned and it was just not 
possible at that point to have them on the team  

1150
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:23,360
yeah just to clarify yeah because it might be 
confused by people in what we're saying here uh  

1151
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:28,960
that like gemma and george were like fired on 
the same premise they weren't removed from ab  

1152
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:35,200
on the same premise there was a different uh 
scenario for those both individuals like we  

1153
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:39,200
a different decision process for both 
those individuals there were different  

1154
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:43,520
things that occurred with george as well it 
wasn't just one thing it wasn't one comment  

1155
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:48,880
or one point multiple comments and then 
multiple conversations that we were having that  

1156
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:56,160
made it clear that yeah but it was different 
and it wasn't just this no i was like another  

1157
01:56:56,160 --> 01:57:01,840
example was about how because the comment that 
you just read out i didn't remember that one  

1158
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:10,480
but i know there was another one going around 
what our team said systemic oppression doesn't  

1159
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:15,680
exist in the west or something like that which 
we were getting lots of messages about and so i  

1160
01:57:15,680 --> 01:57:19,520
do remember that very clearly right there 
were i think there were multiple things  

1161
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:25,360
otherwise we wouldn't just ask someone to leave 
the team over one comment especially someone who  

1162
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:32,320
was an asset to the organization george was 
a prized member of the team whom i really  

1163
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:37,840
liked working with and i thought that he was a 
great member so it's ridiculous that we would  

1164
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:44,800
um yeah it's tough to be in this position 
um you know that's the thing also like  

1165
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:54,080
it sucks to have to fire someone like george 
yeah i just want to add because it's okay to have  

1166
01:57:54,080 --> 01:58:00,960
your own political views your religious 
views but if you are commenting as a v  

1167
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:07,440
as a part of the team and then those views are 
coming through your comments and your messages  

1168
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:12,960
then that's not okay because within the team 
like i said we have over 20 people or something  

1169
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:19,440
and we all have different views and then we have 
our own political views or our own views on god  

1170
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:24,800
or religion or whatever but you never see us 
commenting about it when we're commenting as a  

1171
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:30,720
v because av is supposed to represent something 
that is just about the animal so regardless of  

1172
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:36,240
your views you can be a part of that and that 
was the issue that it was just not possible to  

1173
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:43,200
to have that with those individuals and people 
don't seem to be wanting to work with us to create  

1174
01:58:44,240 --> 01:58:49,440
the most conducive organization 
that is dedicated to the animals  

1175
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:55,840
people don't seem to be working with us to 
achieve this we seem to be dedicated to it and  

1176
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:03,040
everyone seems to be pushing back and pushing 
back and pushing back we are open to ideas we  

1177
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:09,440
want to see how we can help other like other 
things here but we have like assa was saying  

1178
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:14,720
we have other people in the organization who have 
even stronger political views than george do than  

1179
01:59:14,720 --> 01:59:20,960
george does even stronger political views than 
than george does think i mean think about that  

1180
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:29,600
you know yeah sure and they don't they don't ever 
they never let their advices come through their  

1181
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:36,640
work so that's but again when it's not to focus on 
just one point here because it wasn't just one a  

1182
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:43,360
one-dimensional decision it was multi-dimensional 
and that that's also kind of entwined with the uh  

1183
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:49,440
intertwined the with another kind of criticism i 
had about the comments like uh there were i don't  

1184
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:54,480
know if there still are i haven't seen any since 
this but there were quite a lot of let's say rude  

1185
01:59:54,480 --> 02:00:01,680
comments um on on the av social media let's say 
like sometimes i think i even saw one someone  

1186
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:06,080
said you know shut the [ __ ] up like stfu in 
a comment i personally saw that myself at one  

1187
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:10,160
point and i was like who the [ __ ] said that you 
know that was quite a surprise for me to see um  

1188
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:14,800
you know is this something that you guys stand 
behind are you are you okay with like you know  

1189
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,640
going out and telling people like if they're being 
you know if they're acting silly or if they're  

1190
02:00:18,640 --> 02:00:23,440
being silly is that is that with your social media 
team are they like you know go and do that or was  

1191
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:27,840
this some bad actors in the team that are now 
not doing that you know how has that changed i  

1192
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:32,640
haven't seen it since you know it seems like when 
the whole thing happened with george um it seemed  

1193
02:00:32,640 --> 02:00:38,320
after that that social media has been direct and 
but there's not been any of this like shut up and  

1194
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:43,920
you know and the rude comments seem to have almost 
stopped so it was am i right in assuming that  

1195
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:48,960
that was linked or or is this something you've 
changed inside internally and now it's different  

1196
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:54,640
well it's not good it's not it's it's not 
the george it's not that george was just  

1197
02:00:55,360 --> 02:01:04,400
cursing people out using our account um i think we 
need to see like specific examples of where this  

1198
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:12,800
has happened for us to comment more specifically 
about those things but generally we don't just  

1199
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:19,600
curse people out no we don't but we do speak 
in a real way and so sometimes you might see  

1200
02:01:19,600 --> 02:01:26,080
us calling someone a dick because they're acting 
like a dick and it's and it won't be without us  

1201
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:32,560
communicating effectively you know we're not 
just calling them a dick and if you if you just  

1202
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,200
don't be a dick yourself and just conclude it that 
way when you know there's more context involved  

1203
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:45,280
here if you read the entire comment usually you 
can see us responding with an educated a response  

1204
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:51,440
that educates the viewer that the reader and 
we're not just telling them to [ __ ] off or  

1205
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:56,080
to shut the [ __ ] up or whatever it is you know 
that's not that's not what we do we're we're out  

1206
02:01:56,080 --> 02:02:01,360
to edify people hold them accountable when you 
hold people accountable sometimes you have to  

1207
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:06,480
be real with them and you have to pull them out 
and say you're being a dick when they're being do  

1208
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:16,000
sure and and um this links in with the the 
the vegetarian drama let's let's call it  

1209
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,800
so this is something that av does focus on quite 
a lot and nasal i know you actually made a posted  

1210
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:26,080
a video on this relatively recently about 
about uh vegetarians um that's a that's a  

1211
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:30,720
another big criticism that the criticism 
being that av is av attacks vegetarians  

1212
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:35,920
that's the criticism like that that's come up a 
lot actually and i've seen that not only in my own  

1213
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:39,520
you know me asking people for questions 
but also when you're just scrolling and  

1214
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:42,880
if you're in reddit or something like that one 
of the common things that comes up is like av  

1215
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:47,440
is counterproductive because they attack 
vegetarians um i think i already know how  

1216
02:02:47,440 --> 02:02:51,840
you're gonna answer this but um maybe it's a 
bit of an easier one to deal with what do you  

1217
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:55,600
respond to these people who get upset about 
that and say you're attacking vegetarians

1218
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:02,720
which vegetarian we've never 
targeted a specific vegetarian  

1219
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:09,840
we attack vegetarianism and i think 
that vegetarianism is the single  

1220
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,840
greatest cancer in the animal rights 
movement other than vegans themselves

1221
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:21,280
being number one actually vegans vegans are number 
one the number one threat to the animal rights  

1222
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:29,600
movement uh vegetarians are operating in society 
under this idea this image of being on the side  

1223
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:35,120
of the animals to be there they're portraying 
themselves as animal people quote unquote right  

1224
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:43,120
and whenever they speak to vegans generally 
speaking of course majority of these individuals  

1225
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:48,400
are pompous and they tell you that you don't 
need to talk to them because they're already  

1226
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:54,480
vegetarian is the way that they would frame 
it i'm already vegetarian so these people  

1227
02:03:55,120 --> 02:04:00,240
on paper in terms of the facts are 
doing exactly as much as someone whose  

1228
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:04,880
paleo is doing for the animals because they 
don't consume dairy vegetarians don't consume  

1229
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:13,200
flesh dairy is considered more cruel to cows than 
eating their flesh is the dairy industry we as  

1230
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:19,440
animal rights activists tend to say this stuff so 
it's not just me saying that so if that's the case  

1231
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:28,240
paleo people are more in alignment with us than 
vegetarians are but that logic is flawed so  

1232
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:37,520
it's insane that they would get a pass for being 
portrayed as animal people and as long as they  

1233
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:44,880
continue to parade and act like they are animal 
people the longer it will take to get vegetarians  

1234
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:51,840
to become vegan and the more we make a mockery of 
the real animal rights message for everybody else  

1235
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:59,920
and the longer the vegans cuddle vegetarians 
and again i'm not talking about any specific  

1236
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:05,840
vegetarian talking about vegetarianism 
the longer we cuddle vegetarianism  

1237
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:10,160
the longer it will take for animal rights 
to be taken seriously in the public eye

1238
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:16,800
i think i can't remember which one of you said 
it or if it actually was one of you but um there  

1239
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:22,800
was a quote that vegetarians are contributing to 
one less form of animal abuse than a meat-eater  

1240
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:27,840
they contribute to every other form of 
animal abuse it's just not just not meat  

1241
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:32,240
just not flesh and that that was quite for me 
that was very powerful and i feel like that  

1242
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:36,320
that was that was a quote that was a sentence that 
really brought it home to me that actually yeah  

1243
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:42,560
we we we should be targeting vegetarianism 
as you know just the same as we would target  

1244
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,640
anyone else you know who's a non-vegan because 
it's just it's just there's only one between  

1245
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:52,400
them even more yeah even more because non-vegans 
don't say you don't need to talk to me unknown  

1246
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:58,320
they know that they need that's the correct 
conversation to have with them they know that  

1247
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:03,760
they're culpable right it's the same as someone 
who's non-vegan who doesn't support animal testing  

1248
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:09,440
they never buy cosmetics that are tested on 
on animals i mean they don't support one form  

1249
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:15,760
of animal injustice yeah there are many numbers 
they don't claim that claim to be exempt from the  

1250
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:20,400
message regarding meat dairy and eggs vegetarians 
do claim to be exempt from hearing that  

1251
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:28,240
yeah it's just very counterproductive to separate 
like vegetarians and the rest of non-vegans  

1252
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:33,840
because i see that a lot from vegans and animal 
rights activists they think that they should get  

1253
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:38,000
a different treatment but really vegetarians 
are just non-vegan so let's not separate them  

1254
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,480
the reason why we focus on it is because we want 
to change their mentality it's not because there  

1255
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:48,560
is any difference you know we're not like singling 
them out it's the same it's just non-vegans  

1256
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:56,560
it's just clarifying the message on behalf of 
the animals okay perfect yeah i yeah this for  

1257
02:06:56,560 --> 02:07:02,720
me was an easy topic because i'm i also uh focus 
on vegetarians for the same reasons um i think i  

1258
02:07:02,720 --> 02:07:06,240
think it's something our movement really needs to 
needs to shape people need to shake their head on  

1259
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:10,320
this and just realize that these vegetarians 
they're not helping us they're not our allies  

1260
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:16,160
um understanding veganism doesn't help anyone like 
oh i understand you or i'm supportive of you i'm  

1261
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:21,840
a vegetarian it doesn't mean [ __ ] and i think 
the more we start to realize that the better and  

1262
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:28,480
the easier things are going to be in the long 
term um so a style actually i have a specific  

1263
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:34,000
topic for you and this was this was actually only 
brought up yesterday um so that's why i don't know  

1264
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,480
if you've got chance to um yeah i'll i'll i'll 
explain it now so basically the impossible burger  

1265
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:44,960
all right uh you did your video when when was 
it earlier this year i don't know if you've  

1266
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:50,640
thought about it since then but um i think 
it's been like two years now is it two years  

1267
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:55,600
wow okay i don't know i watched it only recently 
anyway so i don't know if you've had a chance to  

1268
02:07:55,600 --> 02:08:00,560
catch up on on that and or if you still think the 
same but um somebody brought this up and they're  

1269
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:05,920
very passionate about it and they wanted to uh 
discuss this um apparently according to them  

1270
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:11,920
again don't know if this is true or not a lot of 
people left or at least stopped going to cubes or  

1271
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:17,040
even some chapters maybe even closed over 
a disagreement about the impossible burger  

1272
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:22,000
and the video that you made i watched the video 
obviously i watched the video i i only watched  

1273
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:27,120
it yesterday so it's fresh in my mind um and your 
position's on the impossible burger and i you know  

1274
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:30,800
went through it and what what how do 
you respond to people who who have this  

1275
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:37,760
like they don't believe that av is abolitionist 
because of you being the founder holding the view  

1276
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:44,880
that you hold that uh an impossible burger um is 
it's it's vegan because they tested on animals um  

1277
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:48,960
i'll i'll explain the video if you want really 
quickly for anyone that's watching real quick i  

1278
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:52,960
watched it yesterday so it's really fresh in the 
video assal basically makes the position makes  

1279
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:58,480
the claim i don't know takes the position that 
practically every single e number and additive  

1280
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:03,920
has been tested on animals at one point so pretty 
much every vegan product you would buy has has  

1281
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:07,600
something in it that has been tested on animals 
but not by the company that you're buying it from  

1282
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:13,840
uh the impossible burger and possible foods did 
the testing themselves and but the product now  

1283
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:18,720
that's in the store technically hasn't been tested 
on it's the product that the one thing that was in  

1284
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:23,760
it was previously tested so therefore it's in the 
same category as another item that you would buy  

1285
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:29,600
um they're both been tested at some point um 
and if you take issue with the impossible burger  

1286
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:34,480
then how long does it have to be before we don't 
take issue with it anymore and it becomes in the  

1287
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:38,960
same category as the other products that have 
once tested on animals that's the position that  

1288
02:09:38,960 --> 02:09:44,720
a cell takes so if anyone's got a question about 
that either superchat it or save it for later  

1289
02:09:44,720 --> 02:09:47,280
but yeah how do you how would you 
respond to someone now who says right  

1290
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:53,120
that that makes av non-abolitionist because 
av is supporting a product that was tested  

1291
02:09:53,120 --> 02:09:57,120
on animals and they take the position that 
because impossible foods did the testing  

1292
02:09:57,120 --> 02:10:02,320
and they have not actually said they wouldn't test 
the gain so impossible have said they will test  

1293
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:08,480
again if they feel that they they say need to but 
let's be honest we don't need that burger right um  

1294
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:13,120
so they say they would do it again and some 
people are saying because of that the av  

1295
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:17,200
is not abolitionist and that's why they don't 
want to work with av anymore how do you what  

1296
02:10:17,200 --> 02:10:25,280
do you think of that well i just think that 
to be consistent um exactly what you said if  

1297
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:32,480
we are consuming products that at one time in the 
past they were tested or an ingredient was tested  

1298
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:39,840
we also use many products that um again were 
either tested or they are produced by a company  

1299
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:46,800
that is not vegan and you know like we can just 
keep going down this rabbit hole but ultimately to  

1300
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:52,400
be consistent with the values that we have i think 
it's okay to say that if you're vegan and you  

1301
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:56,480
eat the impossible burger you're not suddenly not 
vegan that's literally what i was saying i wasn't  

1302
02:10:56,480 --> 02:11:03,760
promoting it necessarily but i was saying um the 
impossible burger is as vegan as the beyond burger  

1303
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:08,240
because one of the things that i don't think i 
mentioned in that video and i think it's something  

1304
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:14,800
that i actually learned after doing that video was 
that when they were working on the beyond burger  

1305
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:20,640
they were buying burgers made of cow flesh 
and they were testing them or they were maybe  

1306
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:26,640
just having a tasting session or whatever 
to get the texture or the flavors right so  

1307
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:33,120
i don't see any difference between the two um 
in one scenario cows are being murdered for the  

1308
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:38,480
burgers and in the other scenario mice are being 
murdered because they're being tested on so i just  

1309
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:43,920
see them exactly the same they're just different 
animals that are being used in the process but  

1310
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:50,240
i just think to be consistent you either have to 
say i don't use anything that was ever tested or  

1311
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:56,640
is ever coming from a company that uses animals or 
uses animal testing or you're just going to have  

1312
02:11:56,640 --> 02:12:02,880
to accept that we do live in a non-vegan world and 
as much as possible yes sure you can avoid it but  

1313
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:07,520
i just don't see the difference between like i 
said that product and other products that we're  

1314
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:13,120
using um like the beyond virgo which nobody 
has ever taken an issue with i haven't seen it  

1315
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:21,280
and if i can just add to this argument that 
we as an organization have made essentially  

1316
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:30,640
regarding this topic uh the only arguments i've 
ever heard from those who are trying to damn us  

1317
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:38,320
by uh saying that we're not like we're not we're 
not abolitionists because we hold this position  

1318
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:45,760
the only argument i see coming from these 
people is an argument for how impossible  

1319
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:52,240
foods as a company is not vegan to which we 
totally agree with the company is not vegan  

1320
02:12:53,360 --> 02:13:02,000
the product itself however is vegan and that's why 
ourselves made the distinction between this and  

1321
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:08,160
any other company that sells a vegan product 
a non-vegan company selling a vegan product  

1322
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:16,080
has always been a product that vegans consume and 
are still considered to be vegan when they consume  

1323
02:13:16,080 --> 02:13:21,760
it uh and we don't you know when you said we 
don't we don't need the impossible burger that the  

1324
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:28,160
same could be said for every other product that 
exists on the shelf so where do you draw the line  

1325
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:35,680
and how do we make veganism practical for people 
by saying you can only support vegan companies  

1326
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:42,960
if you're only supporting vegan companies in 
this modern world we live in i don't think  

1327
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:49,200
veganism is possible that's it's actually i think 
an irresponsible message if we care about animal  

1328
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:56,080
liberation yeah so there's two points i'd like 
to push on a little bit further with this um  

1329
02:13:56,080 --> 02:14:01,520
one of them being that what do you think about 
this is this these are this is internal okay  

1330
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:05,520
i'm with you and i think that i just want 
to put this point away actually that this  

1331
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:09,520
will not in my opinion what we are discussing 
here is the message we put out to the public  

1332
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:14,240
because i don't believe that that's it's it's 
going to be in any way uh beneficial for us to  

1333
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:21,040
slam the impossible burger to the non-vegan public 
right that doesn't make any sense um whatever they  

1334
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:27,760
tested it on animals yeah it's [ __ ] but um 
it's making tracks with non-vegans and it's it's  

1335
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:32,240
i don't know it's it's i feel like it's more 
of an internal thing that that we discuss in  

1336
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:37,360
this like as part of the animal rights movement 
should this be an accepted thing like into the  

1337
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:40,720
movement or into veganism should this burger 
be accepted should these products be accepted  

1338
02:14:40,720 --> 02:14:46,640
i feel like that's what we're discussing more 
than a public statement um and that being said  

1339
02:14:46,640 --> 02:14:49,680
so a company like i mean that's where i 
stand on it anyway that's why i don't really  

1340
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:52,560
i don't want to get into like should we 
talk about it you know pushing it to the  

1341
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:57,280
public or not i don't really think advertising 
vegan consumerism is i don't really agree with  

1342
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:00,640
that anyway i'm not posting about subways 
vegan option or mcdonald's vegan options

1343
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:08,320
has never done yeah no i know that's yeah i think 
we're on the same page with that that's why i  

1344
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:12,400
just i think we can just kind of go on because 
i don't i don't like that i see others doing it  

1345
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:17,680
i'm like okay cool but it doesn't sit right for 
me to promote these massive monster companies uh  

1346
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:23,600
it doesn't feel right um but but if people do it 
that's their call right it's not for me my point  

1347
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:28,480
i was going to make though with this is that so 
for example quorn is a massive company in the uk  

1348
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:33,360
i don't know if they're in australia too but they 
uh they're one of the oh cool so like the og like  

1349
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:38,560
um fake meat mock meat companies and they they 
have this thing called microprotein and that was  

1350
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:44,160
tested on animals when they first released it but 
the pushback was so intense and from vegetarians  

1351
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:50,320
that they had to like reconvene and they released 
a statement where basically the uh i think it was  

1352
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:56,720
the ceo i can't remember it's on their website 
right now um he basically says that he he regrets  

1353
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:01,200
it that he wishes that he did it differently 
or she i can't remember if it's a guy or a girl  

1354
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:05,520
and they said they will never test on animals ever 
again this company will never do it ever again  

1355
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:12,400
and we totally listen to your feedback and it's 
done um versus unfortunately the impossible burger  

1356
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:15,840
impossible foods and i think beyond 
foods as well i think beyond me also  

1357
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:19,520
say this they're saying the opposite like 
they're saying they're going to continue to test  

1358
02:16:20,160 --> 02:16:24,000
for me and for many i think that's where they 
draw the line and say wait a minute okay testing  

1359
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,800
once is one thing testing once and saying yeah we 
see you're pissed off and we know it's wrong but  

1360
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:33,280
we're going to do it again if we if we want to 
they they draw a distinction between these two  

1361
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:37,040
companies and one being like okay we'll support 
this one and the other one they say no we're not  

1362
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:41,359
going to support them because they're pro with 
a section you know where do you stand on on that  

1363
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:48,478
comparison that logic doesn't work that logic does 
not work because corn is still selling products  

1364
02:16:48,478 --> 02:16:54,958
with cheese and egg in it um or at least egg yeah 
they have a vegetarian range and a vegan brain  

1365
02:16:54,959 --> 02:17:00,559
so yeah okay they're against animal testing 
they're still not a vegan company however yeah in  

1366
02:17:00,559 --> 02:17:06,719
exactly the same way that impossible foods is not 
a vegan company so sure but comparison then yeah  

1367
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:13,840
yeah well no it's just people are getting 
angry about what they choose to be angry about  

1368
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:19,040
yeah i think it's about being consistent 
that's a great point because they're not  

1369
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:24,160
a vegan company and the whole range is not 
vegan so why are we only taking issue with  

1370
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:27,840
animal testing and not what happens to 
the animals in the dairy egg industry  

1371
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:33,439
sure sure it's about that's my bad that's a 
bad comparison with corn um i guess what i  

1372
02:17:33,439 --> 02:17:37,919
was trying to get at is is uh we've supported 
a company that is going to say that they're  

1373
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:43,439
going to continue to test on animals but is 
producing um plant-based burgers like is is  

1374
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:47,919
there no is is there no ethical consideration to 
be hard here i guess is what i'm trying to say  

1375
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:57,040
of course come on man of course there it is of 
course of course we need to ask impossible foods  

1376
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:04,639
to cut the [ __ ] and stop testing on animals and 
to be vegan but the point here is that expecting  

1377
02:18:04,639 --> 02:18:12,559
them to be vegan before you buy their product 
which is vegan stand alone in and of itself is  

1378
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:19,280
just a ridiculous uh standard to apply if you're 
going to do it you have to be consistent and that  

1379
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:24,160
would make it impractical to be impractical to 
be negan it would make it impossible to be vegan  

1380
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:29,919
and i don't mean to use that pun 
but we're in an impossible situation  

1381
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:37,120
sure okay okay um yeah i think that's all i 
wanted to ask about that i don't think there's  

1382
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:41,680
anything else i can go through do you have 
anything to close on that with it being mainly  

1383
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:45,200
the questions targeted at you is there anything 
else you'd like to say to people who are still  

1384
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:51,200
like dubious about this or unsure about this i 
think that's it just the last point that you said  

1385
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:59,760
about um you know how they've they've basically 
said they will test in the future and then coin  

1386
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:05,840
saying they will never do it again i just think i 
personally on a personal level i don't take that  

1387
02:19:06,799 --> 02:19:11,919
seriously anyway just because the ceo came out and 
said something i don't take it either way i don't  

1388
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:18,000
take it as seriously as others actually forget 
because i just think okay i'll just wait and see  

1389
02:19:18,639 --> 02:19:24,719
in future if impossible keeps doing it 
then i will not be supporting it anymore or  

1390
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:30,240
um at the same time i don't trust that 
company that says we will never do it again  

1391
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:34,799
i just don't trust people like that because they 
might do it and at the same time they are abusing  

1392
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:40,479
other animals anyway so that's why like somebody 
just making a statement on their website is not  

1393
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:46,959
i don't take it that seriously no one no one 
is protesting magnums the vegan magnums the  

1394
02:19:46,959 --> 02:19:54,000
company whether they put out a statement or not 
uh are saying in their actions that they do not  

1395
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:59,760
reject animal abuse that they will continue to 
condone it and sell products and make money off  

1396
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:04,399
the backs of animals because just look at the 
rest of their range same could be said about  

1397
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:10,399
cliff bars same could be said about literally 
every other product that we as vegans consume  

1398
02:20:12,399 --> 02:20:18,879
and these companies that they come from are not 
vegan companies so it's just asinine to expect  

1399
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:25,840
this uh from impossible like just because you eat 
their burger it doesn't mean you condone them as a  

1400
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:33,359
company if that's the case you're condoning every 
company you ever purchase anything from but you're  

1401
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:39,519
really just condoning that product you're really 
just buying a product yeah and then to people  

1402
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:43,200
that take that position and some people do take 
that position that by buying the product you're  

1403
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:50,960
in the company um and um and it's like you said 
i think it's practically impossible uh to do that  

1404
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:56,000
but then they would argue that okay but it's not 
it's practically impossible but then surely that  

1405
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,000
that's that's the same as saying it's practically 
impossible to be vegan but we're just doing  

1406
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,760
the best we can and we're going to make extra 
efforts to not buy from companies that we know  

1407
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:08,640
are are really bad though what do you think 
that would be an incorrect statement because  

1408
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:13,680
that would suggest a different definition 
of veganism veganism is literally defined by  

1409
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:19,200
avoiding animal abuse as much as 
practically possible it's not practical  

1410
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:24,719
to carry out veganism in the way that 
it's being suggested in in all this stuff  

1411
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:29,439
it's just that's not practical we're not 
even talking about a scenario where you have  

1412
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:34,559
two options in front of you one from a vegan 
company and one is an impossible burger and  

1413
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:39,840
you have no other food options because you're on a 
desert uh you're on a deserted island or something  

1414
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:45,680
that's not the scenario we're in here uh because 
in that scenario obviously the better thing to do  

1415
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:54,080
would be to choose the product from the vegan 
company um but it's not as black and white as this  

1416
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:59,760
okay cool all right we'll close that chat to it 
we've got just two more topics left and then we'll  

1417
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:04,080
we'll go to a q a so um i don't know how many 
people are left from the beginning but there were  

1418
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:08,000
a lot of questions coming in earlier and i'm not 
prepared to go through the chat to find them so  

1419
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,479
if you have questions uh you're gonna have to 
save them and type them again when we do a quick  

1420
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:17,519
q a um and as i said if you if you're planning 
on asking questions keep it sensible or we just  

1421
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:22,720
won't answer it it's a waste of your time typing 
it if you're gonna be stupid so just keep that in  

1422
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:28,560
mind um all right the last last two points then 
just the first one i want to talk about this it's  

1423
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:32,720
linked to something we discussed earlier actually 
about the the people complaining or claiming they  

1424
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:37,840
weren't getting funded you know like they weren't 
getting the av fund or whatever and it links into  

1425
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:44,720
an overall problem of organizers in av getting 
somehow feeling that they haven't been supported  

1426
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:47,680
or they feel like they haven't been supported 
by you or they feel like they've been actually  

1427
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:52,000
had the opposite like some some ex-organizers 
go out there and claim that they were actually  

1428
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:57,520
um i don't know what you would say you guys were 
rude to them or they were treated badly by av  

1429
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:04,000
and that's why they left or or um they were booted 
out or something you know i'm being generic here  

1430
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:08,479
in general because every time i've pushed for 
more information on these claims i've had i've had  

1431
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:12,879
nothing right so i'm bringing it up as a general 
topic and you don't need to answer it as if it's  

1432
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:16,720
like oh this one individual or something because 
they never provided me any screenshots or anything  

1433
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:22,319
so i've got nothing to show you um but what why 
are they doing this why do you think this this is  

1434
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:28,880
coming up from ex organizers where they're saying 
i wasn't supported or i was treated badly um where  

1435
02:23:28,880 --> 02:23:32,480
where is that coming from do you think there's any 
truth to it you know what are your thoughts on it

1436
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:39,760
no there's no truth to this because we um

1437
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:45,840
we provide support for every 
chapter for every organizer equally  

1438
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:53,200
right we've got all these different things and 
procedures and systems in place that provide  

1439
02:23:53,200 --> 02:24:00,319
support from us um to the regional organizers 
we have a manager that manages the regional  

1440
02:24:00,319 --> 02:24:07,679
organizers and then so all of the organizers have 
the ability to reach out to us personally in their  

1441
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:14,479
chat at any moment if they need support if they 
need advice if they need any kind of help and we  

1442
02:24:14,479 --> 02:24:20,879
always help them and we provide support where 
we can so to just leave and say that they felt  

1443
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:27,359
um like they were not supported or they were 
treated badly it's just yeah we need to see  

1444
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:32,559
the evidence because it's easy to just make these 
statements but where is it coming from again it's  

1445
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:38,240
just because people think okay i'm going to leave 
av because all these people said paul is racist  

1446
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:44,000
and this and that and so now i'm going to just 
jump on the bandwagon and say abe treated me badly  

1447
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:48,560
that's the only thing i can think 
of there's no evidence right

1448
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:58,720
i don't think it's much of a help to anybody 
for us to comment on this any further than that  

1449
02:24:58,720 --> 02:25:05,680
because there's no specific thing to that we're 
responding to yeah i'm just trying to get it you  

1450
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:10,720
know i i agree with you i don't like bringing 
this up because there's no i've got nothing to  

1451
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:15,280
show you know what i mean and i feel like i've had 
multiple conversations i've had conversations i'll  

1452
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:19,120
be honest with you i've had conversations with 
people that i would consider to be good friends  

1453
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:25,120
and i've had to be quite harsh and say look 
either give me something here or you're full of  

1454
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:30,000
[ __ ] like i'm sorry and we've kind of like got 
into an argument and just agreed to disagree on it  

1455
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:35,200
because they wouldn't give it to me because they 
didn't have it and um so i've got to say i hold  

1456
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:40,479
i hold a bit of a bias on this because i've 
experienced the [ __ ] first hand and it's it's  

1457
02:25:40,479 --> 02:25:45,040
really disappointing to see and it kind of happens 
to me as well obviously people say things about me  

1458
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:49,200
and i say okay great give me some evidence tell 
me where i've said that and they disappear you  

1459
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:57,359
know um so i it's it's it's a it's a symptom 
of a larger problem i think yeah um yeah yeah  

1460
02:25:58,479 --> 02:26:04,319
for sure yeah and then the final the final 
thing we'll go into then is actually about  

1461
02:26:04,319 --> 02:26:08,880
the effectiveness of av so this is a good thing 
or not just av but of animal rights activism but  

1462
02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:13,600
the activism that we're doing so somebody 
did message me and they told me um ask them  

1463
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:18,800
they started off with a shitty message they said 
ask them why why the cube of truth doesn't work  

1464
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:23,280
so i was like okay what are you talking about they 
said right look the number of animals being killed  

1465
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:29,359
is on the rise and um the challenge 22 sign ups 
for last year i think it was last year was only 2  

1466
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:34,160
000 in the entire world so clearly it's not 
working so i broke that down into two sections  

1467
02:26:34,160 --> 02:26:38,720
and this is two things i want to go through like 
one side of this is that obviously if the number  

1468
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:42,880
of animals being killed is increasing it's not 
just av that's not working it's every single  

1469
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:48,080
activism group that's not working because clearly 
you know save isn't working dxe isn't working  

1470
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:51,359
direct action isn't working hunt's tabs aren't 
working nothing's working because the amount of  

1471
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:56,960
animals being killed is on the increase right 
so that's that's a topic why is that happening  

1472
02:26:56,960 --> 02:27:03,200
um you know what can we do about it as one topic 
and the other topic is um why the um challenge the  

1473
02:27:03,200 --> 02:27:09,920
vegan 22 av signups um they seem to be a lot 
lower than what would be expected of a of you  

1474
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:14,399
know considering how much work goes in into the 
cubes right so i think let's maybe start with the  

1475
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:18,639
challenge 22 one because that might be an easier 
quicker one to go into and then we'll close on the  

1476
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:23,439
on the set on the other one so what with 
the challenge 22 reporting um firstly is  

1477
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:28,160
that accurate like what's going on with that or 
how is it only at 2 000 for like the whole year  

1478
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:34,800
nah first of all it's not accurate because many 
people wouldn't use it also at some point we  

1479
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:40,560
stopped promoting it and using it anyway because 
we realized that challenge 22 is now really  

1480
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:48,720
aligned with av in terms of how they promote 
veganism and so we stopped promoting it and maybe  

1481
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:54,640
some organizers some volunteers are still using 
that link when they arrest someone at a cube but  

1482
02:27:55,600 --> 02:28:01,840
it's not being done the same way anyway i think 
when did we start doing this when we when did we  

1483
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:09,920
stop using the link last year at least a year and 
a half yeah wait it's it could even be up to two  

1484
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:14,960
years now but it's at least a year yeah i think it 
was last year at some point we realized that we're  

1485
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:21,760
just not aligned we stopped using it and um even 
when we were promoting it and it was on the card i  

1486
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:27,920
can average someone and i can say you know you can 
go and sign up and use this link but that person  

1487
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:32,160
is not necessarily going to do it even if they 
do decide that they want to be vegan so that's  

1488
02:28:32,160 --> 02:28:37,280
why it's not a good measurement and we all the 
way that we communicate animal rights to people  

1489
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:44,319
is so simple and easy to digest and with so much 
personal individual accountability attached to it  

1490
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:52,080
that the why factor is is something we focus so 
heavily on hammering into people that the how  

1491
02:28:52,080 --> 02:29:00,399
factor is something we empower generally we 
empower other the the bystander to take on within  

1492
02:29:00,399 --> 02:29:06,879
their accountability it's their responsibility 
to be to be to you know properly plan how they're  

1493
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:12,399
going to be vegan by simply using google and we 
we sometimes say exactly that you know google is  

1494
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:17,839
all you really need to be to be vegan uh we want 
it to be simple for people we don't want to make  

1495
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:23,520
it sound like you need to be in a 22-day program 
when that's not even true you don't the fact is  

1496
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:29,120
you do not need that is it helpful for some people 
but not for everyone and that's not the message  

1497
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:35,439
that we believe is important we need to clarify 
it further by saying all that's needed is the  

1498
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:42,240
why factor the how you will figure out if there 
were vegans 50 years ago you can be vegan now

1499
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:49,040
absolutely okay i think i think that's i'll give 
you my personal opinion on that as well because  

1500
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:55,760
i think that's fair um and i think i don't know 
to gauge the success or or failure by how many  

1501
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:00,399
challenge 22 sign-ups seems a little bit there 
are seems a bit short-sighted uh considering  

1502
02:30:00,399 --> 02:30:05,759
that you know you see conversations with someone 
like you know hudson for example he was a great  

1503
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:10,960
activist and some of his conversations just you 
blow someone's mind you know and do they sign up  

1504
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:16,640
for vegan 22 maybe not but but their mind has been 
blown like you know you can't undo that like maybe  

1505
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:22,080
they don't do vegan 22 but the idea that they 
could potentially go vegan is still is still there  

1506
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:27,920
you know they've definitely made some connections 
so i think engaging the success based on that is  

1507
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:32,000
is a little bit well not a little bit it's very 
short-sighted and it does it does bring up the  

1508
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:36,800
question though of of how can we gauge success 
right because currently this leads on to the  

1509
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:41,600
next question that we can gauge our failure by the 
amount of animals being killed on the rise right  

1510
02:30:41,600 --> 02:30:46,319
so that that's something i feel that we all have 
to take as a bit of a slap in the face like okay  

1511
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:51,840
we're trying but you know clearly something isn't 
working as effectively as we'd like it to be or  

1512
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:58,000
we've got a long way to go right um so how can we 
gauge success how can we know that we're working  

1513
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:03,200
towards you know the right place when it looks 
like we're not if you look at the global statistic

1514
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:11,200
hey look i would agree that animals and the 
animal rights movement has been pushed back  

1515
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:14,960
even further this year than it was 
last year i would agree with that

1516
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:22,160
all right yeah but to say that we shouldn't 
fight for animals in the way that we're doing it  

1517
02:31:22,160 --> 02:31:31,599
is ridiculous uh i i would judge incremental wins 
by saying that you know in our network i'm seeing  

1518
02:31:31,600 --> 02:31:38,161
more and more people than ever before speaking 
correctly about this and that's beautiful okay  

1519
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:43,200
we're ending human supremacy we're holding 
people accountable and we're spreading a clear  

1520
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:50,560
vegan message on behalf of the animals so for 
me that's what that's one win that i would use  

1521
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:56,000
as an indicator for us moving in the right 
direction and i think more and more vegans are  

1522
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:06,880
taking on board this this need to to be serious 
about how we're being perceived by others and like  

1523
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:11,040
taking that seriously and being wanting wanting 
to be taken seriously when it comes to this  

1524
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:20,240
uh i don't even think that many others are really 
even taking that into account but i think more  

1525
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:26,000
and more people are actually on boarding this 
attitude which i think is another great indicator  

1526
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:32,720
uh i think there are other great indicators we 
could point at but i guess it depends on the  

1527
02:32:32,720 --> 02:32:40,640
way you see it and i guess also whether you're 
an optimist or you're a pessimist and um and  

1528
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:46,080
we don't think that you should just do 
one thing anyway like people should do  

1529
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:49,920
what they think is effective and they should be 
as effective as they can possibly be doing it  

1530
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:56,880
and uh we need people fighting in politics we 
need people fighting in government we need people  

1531
02:32:56,880 --> 02:33:01,760
fighting in corporate we need people fighting on 
the streets we need people fighting in hollywood  

1532
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:07,599
it doesn't stop this fight is is multi-faceted 
and it needs to continue at every level  

1533
02:33:09,359 --> 02:33:15,359
yeah absolutely i think also something that's not 
being considered is that although some countries  

1534
02:33:15,359 --> 02:33:20,719
uh there may be reductions in how much how much 
animal products are being produced right or how  

1535
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:25,680
many people are consuming them or using them 
um whereas other countries are on the rise like  

1536
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:30,720
for example unfortunately india is one of those 
countries uh where i know we have a few indians  

1537
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:35,120
here in the chat who can you can also you know 
vouch for this that the amount of animal products  

1538
02:33:35,120 --> 02:33:40,240
specifically meat uh being consumed in india is 
actually increasing and there are other countries  

1539
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:45,040
uh especially in the east who are having the same 
situation previously they had very low consumption  

1540
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:50,080
and now because of the western influence they are 
consuming more whereas it seems like some western  

1541
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:55,040
countries are on the flip side of that they're 
consuming less so this is you know without without  

1542
02:33:55,040 --> 02:34:00,720
the hard data to really show and really dive into 
everything that's happening we can't just make  

1543
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:06,080
a general statement that we're losing you know 
we need to actually look at which countries are  

1544
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:14,160
having an impact and which aren't and why and dig 
deep into each situation right um and i agree with  

1545
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:19,040
everything you said also about um you know getting 
the message right and it's reassuring to know that  

1546
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:23,600
the more people are starting to be more 
unapologetic i think the word would be  

1547
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:30,880
about defending the animals yeah yeah and i also 
want to say that we don't have definitive numbers  

1548
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:38,640
either way on this on the amount of animals being 
oppressed so i am skeptical of whatever data  

1549
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:45,520
people are using to make these assumptions or to 
make these declarations about where things are in  

1550
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:54,241
terms of the numbers so i i question that because 
i remember when a bite-sized vegan did a video  

1551
02:34:54,960 --> 02:35:02,399
and she was trying to in that video give people 
the kill count and even she concluded in that  

1552
02:35:02,399 --> 02:35:10,080
video there's no way to determine this we i i'm 
only uh making an educated guess here okay so  

1553
02:35:10,080 --> 02:35:14,960
even after hours and hours of research being put 
into that video that was her conclusion but how  

1554
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:22,319
are these individuals coming to this conclusion 
when is this where is this data even being logged  

1555
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:27,520
how all those marine animals that are slaughtered 
in the fish industry are they being logged  

1556
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:34,399
who's who's noting how many animals are being 
murdered like it's all an assumption and um i  

1557
02:35:34,399 --> 02:35:40,080
wouldn't trust any any piece of information 
coming from animal agriculture of course or  

1558
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:45,519
any study that's funded by animal agriculture of 
course if it says something to the effect that  

1559
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:49,360
their products are on the rise and they're doing 
really well and all this i wouldn't trust that  

1560
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:55,359
and especially since we know actually that the 
dairy industry is on its way out there's many  

1561
02:35:55,359 --> 02:36:01,839
indicators of that so it depends on what you're 
looking at and i need more data and more evidence  

1562
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:08,880
to even entertain the notion that uh that it's 
going in the opposite direction in terms of the  

1563
02:36:08,880 --> 02:36:14,720
numbers however in terms of public perception and 
the way that animal rights is perceived publicly  

1564
02:36:14,720 --> 02:36:19,680
now animal rights has been pushed even further 
back than it was last year i do agree with that  

1565
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:28,240
yeah no totally i agree all right that brings us 
to the end of my topics um and now if you've if  

1566
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:32,399
you've i guess it's late for you guys actually 
but if you do have another like let's say let's  

1567
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:36,639
limit it to maybe like i don't know would you 
agree for another 20 minutes is that okay 30  

1568
02:36:36,640 --> 02:36:42,000
minutes or is that too much for you guys right 
now 20 minutes sounds good all right i can see  

1569
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:49,680
yeah i'm waking up and you're and you're going 
to bed so this is kind of like yeah yeah how  

1570
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:55,120
late is it sorry what time 40. all right okay 
cool yeah we can start to wrap up then so  

1571
02:36:55,120 --> 02:37:00,880
um guys you got to put some questions in um i 
didn't see you putting any questions in so far  

1572
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:04,240
i'm not going to go back through all the way back 
to the beginning because i know some of you aren't  

1573
02:37:04,240 --> 02:37:08,160
even here anymore so if you've got questions 
now's the time and if you really really want your  

1574
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:12,479
question to be asked like right now and you want 
it to make sure you fit it in 20 minutes in the  

1575
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:18,240
next 20 minutes then you can uh do a super chat 
and that will 100 be asked as long as it's not  

1576
02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:25,200
something shitty um to be to put it bluntly uh but 
yeah we're open to questions now for the next like  

1577
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:28,319
20 minutes or so but after that 
i'm gonna let them go to bed so  

1578
02:37:30,319 --> 02:37:36,719
i'm gonna run to the toilet sure man go go 
no worries no worries and whilst whilst i'm  

1579
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:40,399
waiting for that yeah i just want to say i do 
really appreciate you both coming on here i know  

1580
02:37:40,399 --> 02:37:45,920
it's it's mentally exhausting to go through these 
things um especially considering that some of them  

1581
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:51,439
are really ugly accusations right um i've i've 
the reason one of the main reasons i wanted to do  

1582
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:56,080
it as well is because i feel like i can empathize 
with this because i've also been on the receiving  

1583
02:37:56,080 --> 02:38:01,680
end of equally ugly accusations so i know i know 
how it feels when you read that like we all we all  

1584
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:07,120
pretend like yeah well whatever you know whatever 
but like really it does it does get you right when  

1585
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:12,080
you read something so horrible and someone's 
saying it about you i know how it feels so i'm  

1586
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:17,200
happy we could get through this and and you know 
i hope a few people have had uh i hope it's given  

1587
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:22,880
a few people something to think about at least so 
they don't go and repeat this nonsense uh over and  

1588
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:29,760
over again because it doesn't it doesn't feel good 
to read it does it you know yeah i just hope that  

1589
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:36,240
what people can take from this maybe is that they 
start thinking a bit more critically and if they  

1590
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:43,920
hear something they ask for evidence they ask for 
proof you know they look into it before deciding  

1591
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:50,000
that somebody is a racist sexist etc because 
these are horrible things that you can say and  

1592
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:58,160
yeah i just it's sad that people can just use this 
term so loosely now and they don't realize how  

1593
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:05,600
insulting and destructive that is and how much it 
actually takes away from the real victims of these  

1594
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:16,479
um depression so yeah no for sure um yeah i'm 
gonna be honest with you it doesn't look like  

1595
02:39:16,479 --> 02:39:20,160
there's any questions coming in i guess i guess 
we kind of answered so much i guess they don't  

1596
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:24,160
have any anything else that's not being answered 
to be honest i thought about this earlier in that  

1597
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:28,000
we've gone through so many topics that 
maybe there aren't going to be questions  

1598
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:33,439
because there's like 60 people watching right 
now and so far there's no questions so if that's  

1599
02:39:33,439 --> 02:39:36,799
the case we can we can wrap up there's a lot 
of statements though i can put some of those  

1600
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:40,400
on the screen you know just like for the 
last like maybe like 10 minutes or so just  

1601
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:45,200
being king saying here they don't have evidence 
for their claims and when they do it's hilarious  

1602
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:51,680
i i mean this is how it seems to be right that 
they there's no evidence or there is evidence but  

1603
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:56,560
it's not evidence like it's something they have 
made a i don't know they've made it some kind of  

1604
02:39:56,560 --> 02:40:04,400
assumption from or they've twisted right yeah this 
seems to be happening most of the time really yeah  

1605
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:10,319
that's that's me as well you know that's kind of 
i faced that personally uh we do have a question  

1606
02:40:10,319 --> 02:40:14,880
though now from um i'm not even going to try and 
pronounce your name i'm sorry i should oh should  

1607
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:20,319
knights disrespectful mr jackal let's say um do 
you think donating money to animal sanctuaries  

1608
02:40:20,319 --> 02:40:24,639
is worth the money oftentimes the same people who 
say outreach doesn't work advocate for donating  

1609
02:40:24,640 --> 02:40:31,680
to sanctuaries or fundraise themselves well of 
course it's worth the money i think we need we  

1610
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:37,760
need people to donate to animal sanctuaries and 
also donate to organizations like av so that we  

1611
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:43,760
can keep doing what we're doing i think it's all 
needed so once we have these animals who are being  

1612
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:49,840
rescued obviously they're gonna need a home so 
that's where the animal center is coming and  

1613
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:55,360
they can't just operate without the money so yeah 
i think that's obvious that it's worth the money  

1614
02:40:57,120 --> 02:41:02,000
yeah i think maybe they're also alluding to 
the idea that a lot of these same individuals  

1615
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:08,560
will say don't donate to ed or james or av 
or or whatever donate to a sanctuary because  

1616
02:41:08,560 --> 02:41:13,600
it's better and you kind of give the impression 
that it's one or the other you know that there's  

1617
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:19,680
people that that's it you can only choose one 
and you know one should get all the money um  

1618
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:28,640
which which is nonsense obviously yeah um 
all right this is from michael paul and assal  

1619
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:32,960
you're still young do you think we'll be living 
in a majority vegan world in your lifetime

1620
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:40,399
i want to say yes so badly 
i just really don't know  

1621
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:44,879
doesn't feel like in the next 50 years 
or so we're going to achieve that

1622
02:41:47,279 --> 02:41:55,120
to be realistic standing sure i 
think for my side of this i think um  

1623
02:41:55,120 --> 02:42:02,080
i agree but i also see it as positive that we i 
feel like we lay the foundations for the future  

1624
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:07,439
generations that will achieve this so although 
we won't see it be realistic we're not going  

1625
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:11,839
to see it but we can do a lot of good 
work to help the future people to see it  

1626
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:19,600
yeah it's like two-pack said you know we may not 
be the ones to see that but we will be the ones to  

1627
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:25,840
spark the minds of those who will create that 
world and if we don't create it ourselves but  

1628
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:32,959
um i think it's more important to just 
be focused on spending our lifetime  

1629
02:42:34,319 --> 02:42:42,000
on fighting for a vegan world rather than being 
attached to it coming to fruition in our lifetime  

1630
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:46,800
not that this question suggests that it's just 
wondering whether we think it will happen or not  

1631
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:51,920
i guess i just stopped thinking about it and 
caring i guess i just i'm focused on what  

1632
02:42:51,920 --> 02:43:04,240
i can do day to day and uh in our lifetime that's 
all that we can focus on cool agreed um a super  

1633
02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:08,399
question this is a super chat by the way if anyone 
was wondering what that looks like it looks like  

1634
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:12,799
this so you can put a price on it and it means 
that will uh you'll pay for it it means you'll  

1635
02:43:12,800 --> 02:43:17,760
get your question answered so any updates on 
future campaigns for next year once covid is gone

1636
02:43:20,479 --> 02:43:27,679
we're gonna get back to our world tour that 
we were doing i just um just started that tour  

1637
02:43:28,399 --> 02:43:36,559
did two cities ended it as a result covered 
so that tour will continue and then we will  

1638
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:41,439
pardon me we will do two weeks of truth 
which we're really looking forward to doing  

1639
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:48,880
we're going to do one damn week and 
we're going to do what was the other one  

1640
02:43:49,439 --> 02:43:57,279
uh we're going to do the av academy 
it's going to be a boot camp um and

1641
02:43:59,439 --> 02:44:06,160
yeah that's it yeah we will do those things 
once this whole thing's over awesome cool  

1642
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:10,080
um i've got another question here 
but i'll just give you a heads up  

1643
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:15,920
it's a it's a it's a one of those another kind 
of accusational question all right so just gotta  

1644
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:19,040
give you a heads up on it it's one that i 
forgot to cover with you actually i didn't  

1645
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:23,439
have time to cover it with you but i think i 
was gonna cover it i guess we can cover it now  

1646
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:29,760
it's the about the rumor that uh about the 
whole creation of av um this rumor has been  

1647
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:34,800
around for a long time as far as i know i think 
i've seen you deal with it once before on another  

1648
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:40,000
live or something but uh yeah if you could 
respond to this is it true that another activist  

1649
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:45,680
from melbourne created the idea i've never 
this is actually new i've never had this one  

1650
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:53,840
okay okay ask paul to be a violent volunteer 
for them yeah one have you well there's a  

1651
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:59,840
second half of it by the way this is this as 
well this is the second half of that question

1652
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:07,840
so there you go what's that yeah this is 
a completely new thing i've never heard of  

1653
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:17,279
what a wise imagination um yeah that's 
it's interesting because uh nah this is  

1654
02:45:17,279 --> 02:45:22,000
i've never had this one before i'm wondering 
where this has come from and i'm wondering

1655
02:45:24,800 --> 02:45:30,560
yeah i don't what's the what's the correct 
political was the political correct term for  

1656
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:36,800
chinese whispers these days oh god i don't even 
know i i would just say that but yeah you're  

1657
02:45:36,800 --> 02:45:42,640
right i think people would get would get upset 
about that actually no um i don't know okay well  

1658
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:46,800
that's what this is i'm trying 
to use the correct term but uh  

1659
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:53,440
trying not to crucify me guys uh yeah so you know 
i don't really know you know i don't really know  

1660
02:45:54,319 --> 02:45:58,559
what this is but we know about 
the original accusation that came  

1661
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:07,120
from individuals plural in melbourne and 
uh and that's all documented actually it  

1662
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:13,519
came out with the whole liberation is inclusive 
truth of cube uh video that was made about us  

1663
02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:23,120
um they jumped on that bandwagon and contribute 
contributed to the document that was linked in the  

1664
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:29,120
caption of that video wherever it's shared you'll 
see the link and wherever you see that link you'll  

1665
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:33,760
see the document and in that document you'll 
see these individuals who came out initially  

1666
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:42,479
and made this accusation that they created av with 
us and that we stole it from them now this story  

1667
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:51,840
that we're being asked of here is is is is 
claiming that it was uh we were volunteering

1668
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:06,960
according to this person just to close this 
off they say it's they're saying this is a  

1669
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:11,520
direct claim from the person who claims 
to have had this conversation with you  

1670
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:16,880
so it's it's uh it seems like it's um i 
don't know if you don't if you don't know  

1671
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:23,200
this and it's it's it's you know it seems 
made up i guess yeah it's like when someone  

1672
02:47:23,200 --> 02:47:30,160
becomes famous many people start coming out and 
claiming that that person is their cousin right  

1673
02:47:31,279 --> 02:47:35,679
uh and yet that's what this it's kind of like 
the same thing here people are claiming that  

1674
02:47:35,680 --> 02:47:39,680
they created a v but there's no basis for 
any of this we've heard i've heard a couple  

1675
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:47,840
of different uh people trying to claim this over 
the years but um these people aren't doing much  

1676
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:56,880
yeah so that's what they claim to to activism is 
but i uh i i feel for these people if they really  

1677
02:47:56,880 --> 02:48:03,520
want to tear like they want to try to steal that 
from us all the hard work we've put in and all the  

1678
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:09,920
commitment we've given to this organization 
if they want to try to steal that from us  

1679
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:13,600
it says something about what 
they're suffering from internally  

1680
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:17,040
like i'm sorry that they thought 
they need to take from us  

1681
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:22,560
in that scenario because it means that they 
must be hurting somewhere somewhere else  

1682
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:27,121
and not feeling adequate for themselves and i i 
really mean it that i feel bad for these people

1683
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:34,160
fair enough um funny question okay it's kind 
of funny um are you friends with joey carver  

1684
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:40,880
strong again nope no yeah i thought that might be 
the case i genuinely like i didn't say this in my  

1685
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:44,960
video actually but um when i made the video 
about this but i on a personal note you don't  

1686
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:51,040
have to respond to this but i i do hope i do hold 
some hope that that can be fixed between you guys  

1687
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:54,720
that you can come to some kind of i don't know 
i hope that you can be friends again because it  

1688
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:59,600
was you know you had a good thing going it was 
supporting each other it was good it's a shame  

1689
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:04,800
to see it all go to [ __ ] but he did what 
he did and what happened happened you know  

1690
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:11,680
yeah look i forgive him for making a 
stupid mistake he's human humans make  

1691
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:18,960
stupid mistakes but for as long as he won't 
acknowledge his mistake there's no room for  

1692
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:22,640
i don't i can't be friends with people who 
lack accountability it's just not a part of  

1693
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:26,320
my quality that i hold myself to 
and what i expect from friends  

1694
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:33,679
yeah that's understandable it's understandable 
but i can't yeah as many most people i can't  

1695
02:49:33,680 --> 02:49:38,319
help hoping that it can be worked out but it's 
yes it's kind of in his court isn't that the  

1696
02:49:38,319 --> 02:49:44,080
balls in his court on this um someone's asking 
a question that it's it's an obvious question  

1697
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:49,279
uh but i'm gonna put it up anyway because 
it's a yeah you can easily just answer it um  

1698
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:53,120
it's on the transgender topic again they're 
saying you said everyone should be respected  

1699
02:49:53,120 --> 02:49:57,439
we all agreed everyone should be respected does 
this mean that if someone hates transgender  

1700
02:49:57,439 --> 02:50:02,639
people should they be respected this is 
what i mean this is what i mean about nuance  

1701
02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:09,760
uh like if hitler shows up to the cube should 
he be respected like if he just is resurrected  

1702
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:14,160
from from the earth uh comes back to life 
and shows up to keep will he be respected  

1703
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:22,720
uh uh do i have to answer that oh we said everyone 
should be respected we said we meant the person  

1704
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:30,080
who chooses a different pronoun or name as well as 
the person who might disagree with that ideology  

1705
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:37,439
oppressed that's what we meant we didn't say 
the bully or the oppressor so oppression is  

1706
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:44,639
not respected i thought that yeah like because we 
led into that point with saying that actually and  

1707
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:53,359
so yeah no totally totally i i understand this is 
i think i watched a uh this thing with uh bilbao  

1708
02:50:53,359 --> 02:50:58,319
you know the comedian bilbao he he he was talking 
about new ones as well do you know the ginger guy  

1709
02:50:58,319 --> 02:51:02,240
and speaks really quickly i don't know if you know 
what i'm talking about yeah cool so he he talked  

1710
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:07,760
about nuance as well he was saying that like 
everything i say is twisted and he said something  

1711
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:12,399
like he said he was talking about consent right 
and i'm i'm gonna by the way for anyone that's  

1712
02:51:12,399 --> 02:51:16,719
looking for something to get me on here this is 
bill burr's words not my words all right don't  

1713
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:22,160
[ __ ] start here um but basically he said like 
today's world like how how do you even work right  

1714
02:51:22,160 --> 02:51:26,639
so he said like it's all about consent and there's 
you're at risk all the way always and he said how  

1715
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:32,319
do you have it rough now like if a girl wants it 
rough how do you do that because you know how does  

1716
02:51:32,319 --> 02:51:37,599
it work right and this guy in the crowd shouted 
you need to get consent first and he was like  

1717
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:43,439
this is why you can't make jokes anymore he was 
like this [ __ ] [ __ ] thinks that i'm saying  

1718
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:48,560
that i was not going to get consent i never said 
that he was like when did i say that why would you  

1719
02:51:48,560 --> 02:51:53,279
assume that that's what i meant right and he was 
like it's [ __ ] ridiculous you assumed the worst  

1720
02:51:53,279 --> 02:51:57,599
of me and he called this guy an idiot and a [ 
__ ] and like really slammed him for shouting  

1721
02:51:57,600 --> 02:52:02,399
that because it's like i'm not a monster dude 
like i'm making a joke about rough sex i'm not  

1722
02:52:02,399 --> 02:52:06,559
making a joke about not getting consent are 
you insane there's a very big difference and  

1723
02:52:06,560 --> 02:52:10,399
this is i'm saying it because he commented on it 
and it's kind of what's just happened here it's  

1724
02:52:10,399 --> 02:52:16,000
like you guys said respect everyone and someone 
understood that as respect transphobic people  

1725
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:22,720
it's like no that's not what i said no one said 
that jesus do you think i would have let that fly  

1726
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:27,520
in the conversation do you really think i am that 
morally corrupt that i would just let someone say  

1727
02:52:27,520 --> 02:52:31,040
that on my channel and just not question wait 
a minute you've just said you want to respect  

1728
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:36,160
transphobes it's like no i would never let that 
go even if i had someone like some monster on  

1729
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:39,680
the channel i would never i wouldn't let 
that go but that's not the case you know  

1730
02:52:40,560 --> 02:52:43,920
anyway i'm just i've just got off the handle a 
bit there but we're at the end anyway it's fine

1731
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:53,600
it's just as silly as having to say oh with the 
exception of intersex when you're saying there's  

1732
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:58,640
two sexes like why should we even have to say that 
it's an anomaly of course that's an exception to  

1733
02:52:58,640 --> 02:53:06,800
the rule and like you know you don't need to 
say certain things i guess if you are reading  

1734
02:53:06,800 --> 02:53:14,800
between the lines and you are attuned to nuance 
and you don't just see things through this uh  

1735
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:21,279
cancel culture lens where you know is it what what 
billboard said is these days you say something and  

1736
02:53:21,279 --> 02:53:26,719
what you say goes into someone's brain and then 
it gets cut with all of the things that they're  

1737
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:33,359
conditioned with and you know and then it comes 
out of their brain they spit it out after that  

1738
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:37,599
you know according to what they perceive it to be 
and it's usually completely different to what you  

1739
02:53:37,600 --> 02:53:44,080
said and uh it's the same thing here it shouldn't 
that shouldn't that's something that shouldn't in  

1740
02:53:44,080 --> 02:53:48,160
my opinion shouldn't need to be clarified you 
should assume the best in people not the worst  

1741
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:53,680
i i don't understand what you what you have done 
or even what i have done because i'm involved  

1742
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:58,240
in this that question was for all of us right 
because i they're assuming that you have said  

1743
02:53:58,240 --> 02:54:03,920
that and i have i have been like yeah great cool 
like what did i do to deserve that what did you  

1744
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:08,479
do to deserve that assumption like i i don't think 
any of us has done anything particularly you know  

1745
02:54:08,479 --> 02:54:13,200
that horrible to think that any of us would like 
believe that or let it go it's such a strange  

1746
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:17,359
and i think the person's saying it innocently 
enough i don't think they're trying to attack  

1747
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:24,960
but at the same time it's like dude be reasonable 
here come on it's a fair enough question um but i  

1748
02:54:24,960 --> 02:54:29,600
mean i i don't know is it fair enough actually am 
i trying to be nice i don't think it's fair enough  

1749
02:54:29,600 --> 02:54:34,160
at all in my opinion i think it's something that 
if you watched the whole conversation and listened  

1750
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:39,359
without assuming the worst in all three of us you 
would come to the conclusion that that that's not  

1751
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:43,279
what was being said like that you're not going 
to respect a bigger you're not going to respect  

1752
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:48,639
someone who hates trans people like what the [ 
__ ] like what kind of rational person would ever  

1753
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:55,439
have irrational hatred or acceptance of irrational 
hatred like it's not it's not rational to accept  

1754
02:54:55,439 --> 02:55:01,279
that and we've i don't believe we've been acting 
irrationally in this conversation so i just i  

1755
02:55:01,279 --> 02:55:07,679
guess what i'm trying to say is like assume good 
intentions stop assuming bad intentions of people  

1756
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:12,560
um whoever you're talking to really like give 
them a chance to prove themselves to be you know  

1757
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:18,559
good don't don't look for bad look for good and 
assume they want the best i think is it's really  

1758
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:23,200
important we'll have one more question and then 
we'll close off it's it's a it's a nice question  

1759
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:30,240
i think um do the where's the money go people 
have any idea how much unpaid work that you guys  

1760
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:37,840
have put into animal rights do you think thank 
you generally that's a refreshing perspective  

1761
02:55:38,399 --> 02:55:47,359
to hear and not just for our case and uh it's not 
just refreshing for us to hear for you know when  

1762
02:55:47,359 --> 02:55:52,559
i think about us and that and the criticisms that 
we get it's also refreshing to hear that any other  

1763
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:58,400
activist on behalf of any other activist 
that gets similar criticisms like this  

1764
02:55:59,439 --> 02:56:01,519
you know i don't think that 
animal rights activists  

1765
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:12,399
are um getting the opportunity given to them 
all the respects given to them that they deserve  

1766
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:20,960
in terms of acquiring financial security whilst 
being an animal rights activist full-time

1767
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:29,680
if there's any question about 
motives then you just have to look at  

1768
02:56:31,359 --> 02:56:35,519
you know like this person has graciously pointed 
out and i think i think it's refreshing because  

1769
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:41,600
it's it's the kind of perspective that really 
people should have is looking more deeply at  

1770
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:46,880
the work that people do and that doesn't 
lie and if it is a question about motives  

1771
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:51,679
then yeah look at all the work we've done 
when we had no money towards any of this  

1772
02:56:51,680 --> 02:56:57,201
and we put all of our own personal money 
towards everything it's when we went broke  

1773
02:56:58,399 --> 02:57:02,160
putting all of our money into a b from the 
beginning and we will continue to do that  

1774
02:57:03,359 --> 02:57:09,519
to the very end for the for the simple fact 
that it's about the mission it's about what  

1775
02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:17,599
the organization is intended for and uh well 
you know that's the thing i yeah i don't know  

1776
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:23,600
what else to say about this i guess you want 
to answer that yes i just want animal rights  

1777
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:28,960
activists to feel that it's a very viable option 
for them to come into animal rights as an activist  

1778
02:57:28,960 --> 02:57:34,560
to be an activist full-time part-time 
and to have financial security and not to

1779
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:43,840
expect that they're going 
to be walking on on hot coal  

1780
02:57:45,279 --> 02:57:51,439
just because they they do want financial 
security while being by you know while being an  

1781
02:57:51,439 --> 02:57:58,000
animal rights activists i know that we probably 
entertain on this stream we probably entertain  

1782
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:04,479
the accusations maybe too much i don't know 
i'll walk back and i'll judge later but uh  

1783
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:11,040
that's why i think it's important to just know 
that you know we need to hold a certain priesthood  

1784
02:58:11,040 --> 02:58:17,120
and set a certain tone for animal rights activists 
in this movement who may be wanting to come into  

1785
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:21,279
this maybe they want to come into this movement 
and become an activist or maybe they're maybe  

1786
02:58:21,279 --> 02:58:28,080
you're already an activist and you know i want 
them to understand that there's nothing wrong with  

1787
02:58:28,720 --> 02:58:32,960
fighting for the animals whilst also acquiring 
financial security as long as your motive is not  

1788
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:42,000
financial to begin with yeah absolutely and 
we'll wrap it up there i'll just say that um  

1789
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:47,359
i hope that you said we gave too much attention 
to some of these topics and i would be you know  

1790
02:58:47,359 --> 02:58:53,279
likely to agree but um tended to agree but i think 
what i was trying to achieve here is to have this  

1791
02:58:53,279 --> 02:58:57,279
be in my opinion like the last the last time i'm 
going to talk about any of this anyway and i hope  

1792
02:58:57,279 --> 02:59:01,120
the last time you also talk about it because this 
is going to go up on my channel now and it's going  

1793
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:06,720
to have sectors marked for every single topic so 
that any time anything does come up about this  

1794
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:11,200
and and you know someone's saying asking you hey 
what do i say to this you can literally say to  

1795
02:59:11,200 --> 02:59:15,599
them go and find you know the topic that they're 
talking about copy paste and if they don't want to  

1796
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:20,160
watch the video well [ __ ] them then you know 
like they want to keep making accusations fine  

1797
02:59:20,160 --> 02:59:23,279
but if they want to know the truth well we've 
answered it it's right here that was the goal  

1798
02:59:23,279 --> 02:59:27,439
for this so you're right we did give it too much 
attention but that's because this was the goal  

1799
02:59:27,439 --> 02:59:35,120
i don't think most of these accusations deserved 
even five seconds of time but i i do i do i do  

1800
02:59:35,120 --> 02:59:39,920
think it's important to have it somewhere so that 
it's dealt with for good you know in my opinion  

1801
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:44,240
and that's kind of what i wanted to achieve today 
and i hope we've achieved that um thank you both  

1802
02:59:44,240 --> 02:59:48,719
for coming here and doing this you didn't have to 
do it and i think people overlook that as well you  

1803
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:52,880
you you don't owe anyone anything and you did not 
have to sit here and answer these questions and  

1804
02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:57,200
they weren't nice questions they were shitty 
questions um i know what it feels like to be  

1805
02:59:57,200 --> 03:00:01,040
attacked i know what it feels like to be called 
these things and i know how horrible it feels  

1806
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:05,840
when people ask me more questions about it so i do 
understand what you've just been through and i do  

1807
03:00:05,840 --> 03:00:09,680
understand that this was a shitty thing to do and 
i really do appreciate you coming and doing it and  

1808
03:00:09,680 --> 03:00:14,000
i'm sure i'm sure there are other people who have 
people have already been saying in the chat you  

1809
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:18,240
can check later that they also really appreciate 
you coming doing this and and they support you  

1810
03:00:18,240 --> 03:00:25,439
and um one person even said they originally didn't 
support you but after seeing some of your videos  

1811
03:00:25,439 --> 03:00:30,000
they were like okay no i actually really hope 
that they can work this out so you know this  

1812
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:35,760
is people i feel like people want to support and 
i hope this can bring some of that support back  

1813
03:00:35,760 --> 03:00:40,560
for people who have maybe got lost or confused 
along the way because of all this [ __ ] um  

1814
03:00:40,560 --> 03:00:44,880
so yeah thank you so much is there anything you 
want to say clutton closing any points you want to  

1815
03:00:44,880 --> 03:00:52,399
add just thank you also david thanks for uh taking 
the time because it's important i think as a  

1816
03:00:52,399 --> 03:00:56,639
member of the animal rights movement to want 
to clarify these things it's not really about  

1817
03:00:56,640 --> 03:01:01,760
us again it's about the tone it's about the 
precedent we set for others in this movement

1818
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:06,399
absolutely saw any any final words

1819
03:01:09,520 --> 03:01:16,880
just thank you and um thank you to anyone who sent 
their questions or you know anyone who joined this  

1820
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:23,760
live and they were commenting and watching this 
live so yeah that's it thanks for having us david  

1821
03:01:24,640 --> 03:01:30,000
awesome and a little bit more housekeeping just 
before we go um there is another live stream today  

1822
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:34,880
and it will be at 8 pm my time so i don't know 
what that is your time this is just completely  

1823
03:01:34,880 --> 03:01:39,840
separate this is just to discuss uh all of the 
different topics that i went through in the five  

1824
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:43,760
minute friday so people watching if you're if 
you want to come to that and do come to that  

1825
03:01:43,760 --> 03:01:46,960
and it'll be the usual style of live 
stream where we just go through topics and  

1826
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:53,840
uh and also laugh at some anti-vegan kind of 
standard stuff uh so come on come along for that  

1827
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:58,399
and um don't forget to share this video with 
anyone who's giving you [ __ ] if they are  

1828
03:01:58,399 --> 03:02:02,240
giving you [ __ ] and also of course don't 
expect that this video will make a difference  

1829
03:02:02,240 --> 03:02:06,000
some people don't want to understand some 
people aren't interested in av anymore and  

1830
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:10,399
they just they're just done that's totally fine 
don't get upset if it happens just just you  

1831
03:02:10,399 --> 03:02:14,799
do you and let them do them and and that's 
it you know don't don't take it personally  

1832
03:02:15,439 --> 03:02:21,919
yeah i would say it's the same with non-vegans who 
many non-vegans aren't reachable aren't willing  

1833
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:27,040
and there's no point in continuing to outreach 
those individuals either it's the same thing  

1834
03:02:27,040 --> 03:02:34,880
with vegans yep sure all right cool we'll 
end it there thanks so much bye everyone
