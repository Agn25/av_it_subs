8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,199
accusations

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,640
i laugh because some of them are pretty

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,920
funny but now some of them are very

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,000
serious rumors accusations and

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,280
a whole load of questions that you've

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,040
been sending to me um

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
that you want to ask paula nassal the

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,559

voiceless we're going to go through all

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,360
of these things but first of all i just

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,719
want to do a bit of housekeeping with

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,360
you so

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,440
if you are watching this later as in

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,879
you're not watching it live

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,399
if you check across the bottom the

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,920
progress bar you will see it's been

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,520
split up into sections

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,120
so if you want to find the specific

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,719
question rumor accusation or whatever

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,680
that you're looking for

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,000
you can find it right there if you have

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,039
questions yourself

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,879
right now and you are watching this live

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,239
right now you have questions

32
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,959
uh we're gonna do a q a at the end so

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,080
save them for that

34
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,240
but if you have a topic or a question

35
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
that you really really want to be asked

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
right now or or sooner you can use the

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,640
super chat if you use a super chat

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
i will pause and we'll answer your

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
question right away but

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680
but there is a caveat there is a

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,080
disclaimer here if you are spamming

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,200
trolling or abusing anyone in any way

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,439
including if you send a super chat and

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,600
you pay for a super chat and it's a spam

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,640
or abuse

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
it won't be discussed so you'll be

47
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,680
wasting your money i just want to make

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,720
that very clear for you

49
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
and that also goes for the live chat and

50
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,159
it goes for the q a at the end

51
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,320
we won't be tolerating any spam or any

52
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,079
trolling or any abuse so the moderator

53
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,360
will be handling that

54
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,880
i hope it doesn't come to that but i

55
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,920
know a lot of the topics that we're

56
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,040
going to discuss are a little bit

57
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,240
controversial so

58
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,759
i expect that there will be at least one

59
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,360
or two

60
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,720
um so all that being said yeah just keep

61
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,399
it sensible keep it polite

62
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,840
and we'll have a a productive

63
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,719
live stream that's pretty much it so

64
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
with that being said let's bring in

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,758
paul nasal welcome paul welcome missile

66
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,280

all good i'm excited to get through this

69
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,000
and i think a lot of people

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
in the comments have been pretty pumped

71
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,280
as well to uh

72
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,840
you know get through this um i know for

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
you too this is basically like you're

74
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
repeating yourself

75
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
a lot of these things because over the

76
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
years i think i think we've been through

77
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,120
this a few times or

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,200
your own channels and in your own um

79
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,959
social medias but there are a few people

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,560
at least a few people here that have

81
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
been asking a few of the the questions

82
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
already and a lot of people have been

83
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
sending me questions so i'm happy we can

84
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,680
we can do this and you know hopefully

85
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,519
once and for all get everything

86
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,959
discussed in one place so i really

87
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,319
appreciate you coming on and doing this

88
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:50,959
i know

89
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,720
it's not the easiest thing to do um

90
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
so we can kick off i suppose let's just

91
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,920
kick straight in right i mean let's not

92
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
waste any time we're here for a reason

93
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,239
let's kick off with the recent there's

94
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,159
the most recent stuff that's been going

95
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:04,480
on

96
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,920
right now i think most people watching

97
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,599
are going to be here probably off the

98
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,959
back of that i think i don't think we

99
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,400
need to really introduce what av

100
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
is and who you are i think anybody

101
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
watching this is going to know that

102
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,840
already

103
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
so let's just jump in with the recent

104
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,879
stuff and

105
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,000
what's been going on with av with

106
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,920
the the whole situation with joey the

107
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,080
situation with animal safe movement

108
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,840
anita the donor um where are we up to

109
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,560
with this now

110
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
could you give us an update on that just

111
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,799
to kick things off

112
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,480
so we reached out to the donor to

113
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,879
find out if this was a genuine

114
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
um thing you know to

115
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,239
legitimately continue donating to av

116
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,439
and they

117
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,040
replied with more demands

118
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,879
on top of everything that was discussed

119
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,720
in the videos we put out and everything

120
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,040
that

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,799
joey had mentioned so even more demands

122
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,519
on top of that

123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,239
that we had to respond to but we of

124
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,439
course

125
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
ourselves had things that we needed to

126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,440
communicate to the donor

127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
i mean there's obviously a break in

128
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,120
trust at this point and we need to have

129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
a conversation and

130
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,560
re-establish that trust and things like

131
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,120
this and we haven't heard back

132
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
since we've replied so that was over

133
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,160
almost a month ago now

134
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
and we haven't heard back what were the

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,320
extra

136
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,759
requirements they were they were giving

137
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,120
you like what did they add

138
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,400
one of them was for us to delete these

139
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
videos that we put up

140
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
about joey and that that

141
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
was pretty telling of what this was

142
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
really about

143
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,039
right right and what did they give her

144
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,720
like any kind of justification for

145
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,680
wanting that done

146
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,160
or was it just a we request that you do

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,360
this

148
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,240
well it seemed like it was

149
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,919
out of the uh concern for joey's

150
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,560
image or his uh reputation yeah

151
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,320
so so far to get it straight there the

152
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,000
requirements so

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
the requirements for the donor to

154
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,039
continue funding av

155
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,080
are that you delete those videos

156
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
um give them uh of some i don't know

157
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
financial

158
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,400
organization access to all of your

159
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,880
records um

160
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
is the board of directors things still

161
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,759
going they still want you to do that as

162
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
well is that still on the cards or did

163
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,840
they pull that

164
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
like well here's the thing you know

165
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,880
there were

166
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
things mentioned in the email that we

167
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
got from the donor but we don't even

168
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,199
know what

169
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,400
exactly are the expectations on on their

170
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,880
side

171
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
and so that's why we wanted to have a

172
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
conversation with them but at this point

173
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,840
at this point we're not getting

174
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,479
we're not getting that do you think it's

175
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,840
possible that they did that

176
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,039
to save a face as in they

177
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,960
that joey was involved and gave that

178
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,120
response to try to kind of

179
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,199
yeah save face basically would that be

180
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,720
that's fair to say or do you think that

181
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,840
that he actually

182
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
or she i don't know the donor didn't

183
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,759
they actually want to rectify things or

184
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,520
is it just to try to repair some of the

185
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,440
damage to the reputation of joey and

186
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,639
the donor i mean even in my most

187
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,360
charitable of moods towards this

188
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
i can't see it any other way

189
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,479
yeah it feels like that i mean

190
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,080
from an outside perspective

191
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,759
unfortunately it does feel like it was

192
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,240
just an attempt to maybe uh

193
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
i don't know get the upper hand take the

194
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,639
high road you know or appear to be

195
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,080
taking the high road but it's

196
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,240
it's really sad to hear that actually

197
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
you you actually took the decision to

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
take the high road with them and then

199
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,880
they just didn't respond which um yeah

200
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,160
it's disappointing when we heard that

201
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,360
there was this interest to continue

202
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
funding us and have another conversation

203
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,759
then we're like great

204
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
let's have a conversation but then you

205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,360
know we're not going to be bored

206
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,400
and bossed around and

207
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,360
that's not what we designed a v for it's

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
in fact the opposite of that

209
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
and that's part of the reason why we're

210
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
at this point

211
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
that we're at and the reason why we have

212
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,319
an organic following

213
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,599
and you know

214
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,039
it's i think there's just a

215
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,039
misunderstanding of what we do from the

216
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,160
donor's perspective

217
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
and i think that they don't really

218
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
understand that work and they don't

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,919
really understand us and what our

220
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,440
mission is and

221
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
and they they perhaps got involved

222
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,759
without doing their homework and

223
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,479
we wanted to have a conversation so that

224
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,280
we could

225
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,319
get on the same page about things and

226
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,919
we're not able to do that at this point

227
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,400
so that's where everything is left

228
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
at this point yeah i understand i

229
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,400
understand

230
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,479
and it's it's it's something that it's

231
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,840
not a surprise that

232
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
that the donor or anyone basically is

233
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,039
having

234
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,840
some kind of uh you know let's say

235
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,199
strong opinion

236
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,000
towards being like kind of anti-av this

237
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,840
seems to be quite a common thing right

238
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,800
now and i was just thinking about it

239
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,479
earlier about what kind of an example

240
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,199
could i give

241
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,360
you know to uh like i don't know an

242
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,400
analogy to give

243
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
and um it's kind of funny i don't know

244
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,520
if you'll agree with me but

245
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,599
i feel like av has become kind of like

246
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,640
the nickelback

247
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,760
of animal rights it's like

248
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,519
i'm sorry i'm sorry but nickelback are

249
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,120
extremely successful all right

250
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,800
we've won so many awards end this stream

251
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,080
nickelback has won loads of awards they

252
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,440
play loads of gigs

253
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,800
they were successful they got loads of

254
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
fans but it's also very

255
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,160
in to hate them it's almost like a trend

256
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,959
to hate them

257
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,800
right and that's what i'm kind of

258
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
getting at here is that it's not a

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
surprise to me that

260
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
someone is holding really negative

261
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,800
opinions without even

262
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,160
considering what you're doing because

263
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,680
that's the in thing to do that's the

264
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,080
kind of point i was making it seems cool

265
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
like when i put out some messages asking

266
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,600
people hey you know give me some

267
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,800
questions for av

268
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
i had a few people just replying just

269
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,240
just with some you know

270
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,160
real virtue signaling stuff like just

271
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,120
really like just explaining why they

272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
won't go for av anymore and i'm like

273
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,959
that's great but like give me a question

274
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,399
like give me something you know it just

275
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,000
seems like it's cool to say

276
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,560
i don't work with av i it seems cool to

277
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,920
be like that like it's cool to say i

278
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,800
hate nickelback

279
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
i'm sorry to put you in that bracket but

280
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
it really feels like that

281
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,519
you know uh i've got to say and and that

282
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,800
brings me on to the

283
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,120
go on go on sorry everything is a lot

284
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,160
cooler though

285
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,959
yeah i mean come on chad kroger

286
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,760
that much of a loser is he come on no i

287
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,040
used to listen to them when i was

288
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,600
younger

289
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,200
i have to admit i i i know it seems like

290
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,640
it's uh it's

291
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,040
a bandwagon for us to disagree with you

292
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,640
on using that comparison but

293
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,680
but it's uh

294
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,320
that's just a taste in music which i

295
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,120
guess is

296
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
i guess it's a taste in activism

297
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
i guess you could that's the comparison

298
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
you're making

299
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
kind of yeah kind of but i think with

300
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
nickelback

301
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,399
um well anyway i don't want to get into

302
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,880
the comparison

303
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
maybe it's for the best yeah um but i'm

304
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,200
gonna give an example actually because i

305
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,959
did have a plan set up for this stream

306
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,320
but you know what i feel like this is

307
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,360
relevant right now

308
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,200
so i want to tell the viewers a quick

309
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
story here about something that happened

310
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,600
um

311
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,519
i put these messages out didn't i put

312
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,040
these posts out on my instagram asking

313
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,000
people give me some

314
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,120
give me some questions give me some

315
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
topics i put it on facebook and by the

316
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
way one of those posts has blown up with

317
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,360
a load of

318
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
nonsense but anyway that's another topic

319
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,760
but some people responded to me saying

320
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,279
you know certain things and i want to

321
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,800
just bring up one of these responses

322
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,000
that i had

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
um from somebody on my instagram who

324
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,000
who had a story to tell and i want to

325
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,040
just kind of link it in with what we

326
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,959
just said about it's cool to hate av

327
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,519
it's cool to kind of just you know find

328
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,959
something wrong and just

329
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,480
almost even sometimes uh [ __ ] as

330
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,839

and this is real by the way i'm not this

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,399
is not designed this wasn't planned this

334
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,680
is something that genuinely happened and

335
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
i've got the evidence because i can show

336
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,480

instagram and you'll see why this is

340
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000

saying this

358
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
why do you treat your organizers like

359
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,639
disposable garbage right

360
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,480

361
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,760
wow okay that's

362
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,839

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,920
on here so i responded to this person

364
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,200

365
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
yeah i do so i responded to this person

366
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,240
very simply saying

367
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,839

369
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,639

370
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,680
the response i got

371
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
when the allegations of fraud came up i

372
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,560
commented on one of paul's comments

373
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,000
stating something along the lines of it

374
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,200
being standard practice to ask for

375
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,399
financial information

376
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,600
paul was very aggressive in his

377
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
responses even abusive i told him i was

378
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,120
one of the organizers and he told me to

379
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,959
[ __ ] off and leave so i stood down

380
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,320
these are not isolated incidents

381
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,920
unfortunately his temper gets in the way

382
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,120
and he burns his people

383
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,720
his own people good luck so

384
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,399
i i'm not saying that i don't believe

385
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,160
that person and at the time i said you

386
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
know okay i believe you

387
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
but i need some evidence right i need

388
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,160
something to show here do you have a

389
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,839
screenshot do you have something to show

390
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,320
me

391
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,680
that i can show to them and uh you know

392
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,079
i'm happy to discuss it and this is the

393
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,079
answer that i got

394
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,680
i don't he cleans up his message

395
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,279
straight away i know you believe me but

396
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,000
understand

397
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
you need for proof you could perhaps

398
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,360
pose the question more broadly is this

399
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,200
is behavior as a pattern of his

400
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,040
and so will be hard to deny sorry i

401
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,959
can't help you any further david so

402
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,959
it's pretty damning right this is pretty

403
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,639
damning and at the time i gotta admit

404
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,399
that i was a little bit like

405
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,199
swayed because look i know paul and i

406
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,720
know you both paul and the style and i

407
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,399
know that sometimes you know

408
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,399
i lose my [ __ ] too i say things that i

409
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
later come to regret i told people to

410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,519
[ __ ] off i've told i told someone to

411
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,800
[ __ ] off live

412
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
in a live stream by by accident i

413
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,000
thought they were saying something that

414
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,519
they weren't i told them to [ __ ] off and

415
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,560
then they were like why

416
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,800
what's wrong i only said this i got

417
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,320
completely mixed up so it's not it's not

418
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,199
like you know

419
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,600
we're infallible we make mistakes but

420
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,199
anyway i brought this up with you guys

421
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,399
right

422
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,760
and um luckily paul actually had the

423
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,360
screenshots of this interaction

424
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,399
now i'm going to show you what the

425
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,399
actual interaction was

426
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,240
actually hold up i just realized there's

427
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,440
one little thing i need to blur out

428
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,639
but you're not going to believe you're

429
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,760
not going to believe what the actual

430
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,079
interaction went like um

431
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
on the surface of this it looks it

432
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,199
obviously looks like it's a done deal

433
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:33,839
right

434
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,120
and i'm going to explain why this is

435
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
relevant after i've shown you if you're

436
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,000
wondering

437
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
watching this if you're wondering what

438
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,639
how is this relevant you'll see in a

439
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,600
moment

440
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,160
and i'd just like to add that this is

441
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,760
how people commonly talk

442
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
about they be when they say negative

443
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
things about us

444
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,680
yeah definitely definitely this is this

445
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,199
is this is why i'm bringing it up it's

446
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:53,680
it is

447
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,920
absolutely like this and i want to get

448
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
into this as a topic as well it's not

449
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,560
just

450
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,079
a thing but hey look so here we go this

451
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,839
is the actual interaction so this is the

452
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,360
individual

453
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
saying the information requested is

454
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
pretty standard for an audit so this is

455
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
correct this is what she said

456
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
no lies there okay that's in line with

457
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,279
the message i received

458
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
so here's paul being extremely

459
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,639
aggressive apparently

460
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,399
i don't know now requests bank login

461
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,680
details to be handled

462
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,199
handed over to a non-accountant and a

463
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,040
former gang member how is that stuck

464
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,320
that's how stock standard audit is

465
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
carried out is it so

466
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,079
that's the aggressive response

467
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,480
apparently um this person responds

468
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,040
saying

469
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
you know she's upset because the it's

470
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
calling joey a former gang member

471
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,639
um and saying that screenshots could be

472
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,240
manipulated and then

473
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
paul goes to justify himself saying well

474
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,440
joey calls himself

475
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,160
an ex-gang member um okay so not not

476
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,680
nothing really going on there no [ __ ]

477
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
off nothing like that so far

478
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,480
and it goes on you're thinking okay so

479
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,839
where is the [ __ ] off coming where's the

480
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,800
[ __ ] off and leave

481
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,160
part coming right because that's the

482
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
main part here that sounds horrible the

483
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
aggressive [ __ ] off and leave

484
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,040
um all we've got here is paul saying get

485
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,920
out of here

486
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,199
you said get out of here so let's not

487
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
[ __ ] off and leave and then

488
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,320
this person who was an organizer gets

489
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
out of there she decides to leave

490
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
and that's it that's it that's the whole

491
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,759
interaction

492
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,160
yeah can i just pause you there yeah go

493
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,040
ahead

494
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,920
uh so at this point i didn't even know

495
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,160
that she was an organizer that's why she

496
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
says in the next comment oh no paul

497
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
bless you i am one of your organizers so

498
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
she's now informed me of this

499
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,720
after you said get out of here yeah so

500
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
after

501
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
the uh fact but yeah

502
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
just that's it's okay yeah and that

503
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,320
that's exactly it's even

504
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,839
this is my point basically when i was

505
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,199
talking about the whole nickelback thing

506
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:43,839
and

507
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,160
how these rumors get spread and it's

508
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,079
cool to hate av it's because of things

509
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,040
like this

510
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
don't get me wrong i know there are

511
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,639
examples out there of me

512
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,560
being an [ __ ] to people and i'm sure

513
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,839
there are examples out there of you guys

514
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,199
being an [ __ ] to people

515
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,440
but to go and actually take something

516
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,560
that didn't happen

517
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,920
and get it into your head that it

518
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
happened a certain way where you know

519
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,520
you were told to [ __ ] off and leave as

520
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,119
an organizer and

521
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
you know people believe this and this

522
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,799
goes and goes and goes and i guess my

523
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,160
question for you is

524
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,679
how does this happen how do we get to

525
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,919
the point now where we have people that

526
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,000
believe that they have been wronged by

527
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
you they believe it so much

528
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,199
that they go and tell other people they

529
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,640
were wronged by you that they were told

530
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,520
to [ __ ] off

531
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
when there is literal evidence that you

532
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,599
have obviously and it's online

533
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,919
to show that this is not how it went why

534
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,720
does it happen

535
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
and why do people believe it instantly

536
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,720
without even

537
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,960
checking or questioning it like how did

538
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,679
we get to this point in your opinion

539
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
it's for the same reason that you get

540
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,799
hate when

541
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,160
people choose to run

542
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,360
hate campaign small or large against you

543
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,240
and their baseless claims it's the same

544
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,360
reason that

545
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,320
anyone of any amount of influence in

546
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,200
this day and age in this

547
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,799
age of outrage you know in this council

548
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,080
council culture this is the way that it

549
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,240
works right people don't

550
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,280
work off people don't

551
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,240
have standards for information anymore

552
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,720
then

553
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,919
they don't hear something and then

554
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,280
screen it they hear something and they

555
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
say well he said it with conviction or

556
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,799
she said it with conviction

557
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,320
or they said it with conviction and

558
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,880
therefore it must be true and if they

559
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,320
said it in the comments section of a

560
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,360
post with emotion

561
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
it's true it doesn't you don't need to

562
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
do any more homework than that so

563
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
i guess that question is a bit more

564
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
deeper it's

565
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,960
it's it's more of a question about why

566
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,000
humans are the way

567
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,919
humans are yeah

568
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,240
yeah and and yeah i can see so you think

569
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,880
you you're putting it down to the

570
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,600
the more the popularity aspect of it in

571
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,799
that like the more

572
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,039
the more well-known an individual or a

573
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,039
group is the more of this that's going

574
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,440
to come

575
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,559
is that is that am i right and

576
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,120
understanding this is kind of the point

577
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,960
yeah and you know a lot of our

578
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
organizers have had

579
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,360
challenges in dealing with hate that

580
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,520
they get when they come on to

581
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,799
become an organizer and represent

582
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,000
av in their cities because they're seen

583
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,799
as like

584
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,080
working for hitler you know right

585
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,960
and yeah you know we we tell organizers

586
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,160
one of the things you learn

587
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,039
about being a human rights activist when

588
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,440
you

589
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,720
work with us is dealing with that [ __ ]

590
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,480
right and that's part of it if you want

591
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,840
to

592
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
do something of influence within this

593
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,480
world and make an impact

594
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,600
i i i agree

595
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,080
so um let's yeah i think i think that's

596
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
a that's going to be a recurring topic

597
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,640
to be honest with you so

598
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,320
let's let's go on to the

599
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,159
like more let's go into a solid topic

600
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,600
something we can really like get into

601
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,360
and kind of debunk so

602
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,039
one of the more common things that came

603
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,120
up with my questions that came up

604
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
questions that came up sorry topics that

605
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
came up was

606
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,080
about money now we talked about the

607
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,440
donor obviously

608
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,280
but we didn't talk about the general

609
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,720
things that people

610
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
seem to be obsessing over when it comes

611
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,840
to av

612
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,240
so these general money concerns as i've

613
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,840
called on my general money concerns they

614
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,280
include things like people are upset

615
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,240
because

616
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,760
you guys didn't want to release

617
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,679
financial records they're upset because

618
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,640
apparently

619
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,559
that they don't know or you have not

620
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,799
released where donations go

621
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,080
um they're upset because they

622
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,760
the the chapters are claiming they

623
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,280
receive no money

624
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,480
um so so i know you've dealt with some

625
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,919
of this on your own channel and i'm

626
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,200
on your own videos and i guess you're

627
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,440
sick of talking about it but

628
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,159
again my aim today is to get into it and

629
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,120
and to ask

630
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,039
maybe more questions that maybe people

631
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,200
haven't you guys maybe haven't had

632
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
before and to get

633
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,440
really some solid facts and detail out

634
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,799
here so that people can't

635
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,600
continue to discuss this randomly like

636
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,200
you said i feel like we need to vet

637
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,720
these things rather than just taking

638
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,880
people's words um

639
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
so what what is that situation then so

640
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
let's let's be more specific with the

641
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,520
question

642
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,840
there's money coming in and obviously

643
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,280
there's money going out

644
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,840
um people are claiming that there's a

645
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,720
problem that they

646
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,280
don't know what's coming in and where

647
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,159
it's going

648
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
so how would you respond to that like

649
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,919
what what do you think

650
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,919
uh how can you reassure these people

651
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,000
that it's going where it should be

652
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,240
or you know what the situation is what

653
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,360
the financial situation is

654
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,880
i think going back to what you were

655
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,559
saying before about like

656
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,720
how it's the cool thing now to hate on

657
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,840
av

658
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,919
it's also the cool thing to just ask

659
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,760
these questions because you don't

660
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,679
you don't see other organizations or

661
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,120
other activists being asked the same

662
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,080
questions

663
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,840
and the people that are asking these

664
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,480
questions and making the same claims

665
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,120
don't have any kind of evidence to back

666
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,080
up their claim

667
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
so it's just because somebody brought it

668
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,840
up in the comment section and they saw

669
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,440
it they're just going to repeat it

670
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,960
and then the next person is going to say

671
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,120
the same thing so

672
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,480
um like the fact that we have never done

673
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,120
any financial reports is actually

674
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,919
[ __ ] because it's not that we're not

675
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,159
willing to do it as that we haven't been

676
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,240
required to do it yet

677
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,679
and if anyone is actually interested

678
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,679
all of this information is public so

679
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,360
they can just go and look it up

680
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
and they will have access to and they

681
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,480
can see that

682
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,880
um we're required to do our first

683
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,240
financial

684
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,000
um what is it called like reporting

685
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,559
this year end of the year or it's

686
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,600
probably going to be delayed

687
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,760
next year actually because of coverage

688
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,799
but

689
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,600
because we registered av as a non-for

690
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,159
profit

691
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,039
i think it was in 2018 the way it works

692
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,640
here you don't you're not

693
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
asked to do a reporting for like the

694
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,600
first year or the first couple of years

695
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
so it's not that we because otherwise we

696
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
wouldn't be able to run

697
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,480
av if we hadn't done our

698
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,919
um legal requirements

699
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,520
whatever it is that you know the

700
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
government is asking you to do as a

701
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,720
not-for-profit

702
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,320
it's not like you can just say no i'm

703
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
not going to do my reporting and then

704
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
you can continue to run av

705
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,120
as a not-for-profit so um

706
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
yeah like i said these claims are just

707
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,880
faceless there's no evidence and also

708
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,080
people have no reason

709
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,320
to think that the money is not going

710
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
where we say it's going

711
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,880
if somebody has proof that the money is

712
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
going elsewhere then

713
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,679
they need to come forward and show us

714
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,000
where the money is going um

715
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
we have explained this like you said

716
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,679
multiple times we have told people where

717
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,520
the money is going like with all these

718
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,880
different categories

719
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
so we can just repeat that but i feel

720
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,200
like these people are committed

721
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,960
to think a certain way and no matter

722
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
what you say they're just not gonna

723
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,440
believe you

724
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,320
so yeah i i just don't know if there's

725
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,919
anything else that we can say

726
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,960
to clarify this for people yeah i

727
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,799
i guess for the sake of for the sake of

728
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,080
this um

729
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,679
for the sake of this stream i don't want

730
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,760
i i don't i'm not interested in going

731
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,720
through literally

732
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
like i wouldn't expect you to do this to

733
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,240
go through like okay we spend this much

734
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,200
here and this much

735
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,960
i don't want to do that that's just it's

736
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
not you don't owe that to people

737
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
watching this i think

738
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,799
what i'm more interested in is like

739
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
maybe you could just list off

740
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,159
like the things that i don't know the

741
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,840
biggest spending from av

742
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
and like where it goes to give people an

743
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,360
idea because uh maybe some people

744
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,039
genuinely have no idea

745
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,559
where an organization like av would

746
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,159
spend money let's assume they're asking

747
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:44,880
it

748
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,039
out of you know interest rather than out

749
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,000
of accusation

750
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,360
like if somebody asked you hey i'm just

751
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,880
curious like where would it go like

752
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,159
where do you spend the most money

753
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,919
how would you answer that question like

754
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,159
just just to appease them let's say or

755
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,360
just

756
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,360
you know

757
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,679
like the major donations coming in

758
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,760
um so the biggest

759
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
part of it would obviously be the

760
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,159
payments to the team members so

761
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
including myself paul and um at

762
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,320
some point we had just over 30 people

763
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
working with av

764
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,559
so you can imagine how much that would

765
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,679
cost roughly

766
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,720
and then now we've got i think

767
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,240
i don't know actually how many people

768
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,559
we've got like around 20 people working

769
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,440
with us

770
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,279
including us too so the the bulk of it

771
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,720
is going towards payments so that those

772
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,200
people

773
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,640
can continue to work for av and then

774
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,840
the second biggest um thing

775
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,480
has always been the av fund which is

776
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,159
something that we started

777
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,440
um and we would dedicate a certain

778
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
amount of money to go towards chapters

779
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,720
that were

780
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,960
um you know active chapters that needed

781
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,799
some help getting their equipment so

782
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,720
that was always like

783
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,080
the second um biggest expense for us

784
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,159
and then yeah the rest of it is just you

785
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,159
know if if people look into

786
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,159
what costs are involved in terms of you

787
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,559
know all the admin stuff all the

788
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,559
programs that you need the software's

789
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,320
the subscriptions

790
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,480
and then all the big campaigns that we

791
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,360
were doing as well so

792
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,840
okay and with the staff they were 30

793
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960
were they all full-time

794
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,720
30 staff um no we had

795
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,760
so we um

796
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,440
we have people that work with us as

797
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,000
contractors so av doesn't have like

798
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,480
staff

799
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,520
necessarily but um everyone's like an

800
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,159
independent contractor that comes in and

801
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,520
they can do

802
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,120
um part-time or full-time and

803
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,440
um i think i would say maybe it's

804
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,240
half-half

805
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
half of the people that work with us are

806
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,320
full-time half are part-time

807
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,720
um or just come in as volunteers even

808
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,520
sometimes

809
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,039
they they do some work casually yeah

810
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,960
cool okay so i'm just trying to like put

811
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,320
a number on it i think for

812
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,799
anyone who maybe is not following um so

813
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,960
like 30 staff if you had 30 staff that

814
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,440
were

815
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,600
only working let's say like not

816
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,799
full-time hours they so they're working

817
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
part-time hours right so let's imagine

818
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,320
it's 30 staff working 20 hours a week so

819
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:22,799
we'll go

820
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,720
like we'll go low right we'll pitch low

821
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
here 30 staff working

822
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,120
20 hours a week and let's imagine that

823
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,080
the

824
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,600
i'm going to work in yearly salaries

825
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
here like base yearly salary in euros

826
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,399
for example

827
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,000
the absolute minimum you could earn a

828
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,440
year to survive in a

829
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,799
place like i don't know let's pick a

830
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,559
cheap let's baseline everything low

831
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,000
let's go low on everything the minimum

832
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,360
you could earn in a year

833
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,880
in somewhere like spain for example

834
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,240
would be like because that's where i

835
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,960
know

836
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,120
it's like 16 000 euros a year it's the

837
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,799
absolute minimum and that's really

838
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,159
pushing it like it's really difficult

839
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,840
and that would be a full-time salary

840
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,799
so that's like that's half that 8 000 a

841
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,200
year

842
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,880
and let's imagine that's 30 staff that's

843
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,440
240 000 euros a year

844
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
that's it that's pitching low that's if

845
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,039
you have no full-time staff that's if

846
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,120
all of your staff are only working like

847
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,440
like half-time hours let's imagine right

848
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,799
so just to put that into perspective for

849
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,080
anyone who's wondering how much that

850
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,760
would be so like it could it could be

851
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,240
anywhere upwards from 240 000

852
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,000
euros a year which would be like i don't

853
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,320
know 300 000 us dollars maybe something

854
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,120
like that

855
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,320
so that is that is a huge chunk yeah and

856
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,240
i think when i when i first watched a

857
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
video and i heard that

858
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,960
and i worked it out myself at that time

859
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,320
and i was like yeah that's actually a

860
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,279
chunk of money

861
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,200
that i don't think many people

862
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,320
understand right

863
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,480
um it doesn't it doesn't sound like a

864
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
lot but when you actually calculated it

865
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,360
is quite a lot so

866
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
um the next thing then you talked about

867
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,720
the the av

868
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,200
uh fund the for the for the chapters

869
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,279
where does it come from then that that

870
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,360
does this apparently this is a rumor

871
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,799
okay there's no i don't have evidence of

872
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,080
this and i'm sure there isn't evidence

873
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,559
of this

874
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,559
uh maybe there's one or two organizers

875
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,000
who have caused this problem

876
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,760
but where is it coming from that the

877
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,520
chapters are not getting the funding

878
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,200
where has that started do you know where

879
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,320
that came from

880
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,000
or do you know what's going what what is

881
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,919
actually behind it like are they getting

882
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:06,960
the funding

883
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,120
i'm sorry to ask the question but it

884
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
came it came up a lot again

885
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,159
no i think it's the same thing as

886
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,360
everything else like

887
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,240
somebody just started this rumor that av

888
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,520
keeps the money

889
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,240
or specifically paul and style keep the

890
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,320
money to themselves and they don't

891
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,559
send any money to the chapters i think

892
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,600
it's just

893
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,679
again we don't even know where this came

894
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,039
from but

895
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,279
if people were really interested this is

896
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,080
one thing that can be easily tracked

897
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,240
we have a full list of everyone who ever

898
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,600
received the fund

899
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,440
how much they received it what they

900
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,640
spent it on

901
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,120
and um because everyone who receives the

902
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,080
fund

903
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,600
they were supposed to send us the

904
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,679
invoices so it's like

905
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,880
we have all the records and

906
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,240
um i guess the only thing is that p

907
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,200
we weren't um doing it in a way that

908
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,760
just as

909
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
as soon as you become an organizer you

910
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,679
can receive two thousand dollars or

911
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,480
something

912
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,279
it was there were certain criterias that

913
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:07,679
you

914
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,320
you need to meet as an organizer or as a

915
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,039
chapter

916
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,039
you need to be active you need to be

917
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,320
doing a minimum number of

918
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,200
cubes and you need to be you know

919
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,360
operating for a certain amount of time

920
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,240
and then even with that because the

921
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,440
money was limited

922
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,480
we had to pick chapters so

923
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,240
sometimes it was just you know picking

924
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,840
this chapter over the other chapter and

925
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,240
then

926
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,919
next month they would have a higher

927
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,520
chance of getting it but

928
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,000
um yeah there will be many organizers

929
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
that would actually

930
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
be able to come forward and say yeah we

931
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,480
received that and this is what we spent

932
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,080
it on but i mean

933
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,600
our conditions for our criteria for

934
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,000
being

935
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,039
accepted in in getting the funding

936
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,679
was nothing crazy like you had to be on

937
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,279
board for six months

938
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,399
you know just six months and do one

939
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,320
a month i think that's what yeah one

940
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,399
cube a month so you had to do a

941
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,600
total amount of six cubes before we

942
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,000
would

943
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,760
we would look at giving you money yeah

944
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,559
and yeah you know that's nothing that's

945
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,519
nothing too

946
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,559
strenuous i think what's happened is

947
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,440
a lot of organizers don't really pay

948
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,000
attention

949
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,120
to what we do they they come on and

950
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,320
they just do their own thing in their

951
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,159
own cities and they

952
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,919
want to be a king or a queen in their

953
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,159
own on their own mountains

954
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,519
and and literally we've seen so many

955
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,000
people come

956
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
and go who carry this attitude with the

957
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,440
navy

958
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,039
they just do their own thing in their

959
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,039
own city and

960
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,080
they aren't a part of what we're doing

961
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,720
as a global movement and uh

962
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,399
and these people don't really pay

963
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,000
attention to the things that we have

964
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,559
going on

965
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,039
yeah and they don't really know about

966
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:53,679
these

967
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,960
uh things 20

968
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,039
20 details so they don't apply and then

969
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,320
they complain that they never got the

970
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,159
money

971
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,440
right um

972
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,480
how do you how do you think we can

973
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,720
handle that i mean this is uh not even

974
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,200
an av

975
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
specific thing but we can we can talk

976
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
about it for a second that

977
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,240
it's something i've also experienced not

978
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,600
only in av but in

979
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,279
save and also in in even you know

980
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,440
grassroots like non like local

981
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,799
grassroots organizations local

982
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,640
grassroots groups is that there seems to

983
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,000
always be some kind of power

984
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
struggle going on in these groups i

985
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,279
don't know if it's only within

986
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,039
animal rights or if it's also within i

987
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,399
don't know women's rights if it's in

988
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,000
black lives matter i don't know if it's

989
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,039
in all these groups i

990
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,960
have not been in those groups for enough

991
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,720
time to know but in animal rights it

992
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,880
seems to be that in every single group

993
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
there is a power struggle of somebody

994
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,080
trying to take over and somebody else

995
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,600
who's trying to take over that person

996
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,159
and

997
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,840
you know somebody who's trying to reject

998
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
the leader they have or whatever you

999
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,600
want to call them leader whatever it is

1000
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,679
it's it's it seems to be very common

1001
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,880
like what do you think

1002
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,200
what's causing that and uh would you

1003
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,360
have a suggestion on on how to

1004
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,159
how to fix that

1005
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,760
well you know one of the things i'm

1006
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,840
really proud of with av

1007
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,039
is that we really took into account like

1008
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,799
how we're taken by the public and

1009
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,080
the fact that we want to be taken

1010
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,000
seriously and like we want to address

1011
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,399
that

1012
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,960
within the public eye and

1013
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,720
we don't necessarily expect people to

1014
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,440
trust

1015
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,720
our leadership to like trust our

1016
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,960
decision making

1017
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,679
but i think it's safe to say we've

1018
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,960
earned

1019
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,919
a certain level of trust because you

1020
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,320
know we stick to our ship pretty well

1021
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,799
and we do what we do pretty well and

1022
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,519
and uh those who choose to trust our

1023
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,480
leadership

1024
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,960
aren't forced to choose that they choose

1025
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,279
it on their own accord

1026
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,399
and i guess if you want that entitlement

1027
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:58,799
that

1028
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,840
asylum and i have earned

1029
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,840
to run an organization the way that we

1030
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,440
choose

1031
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,719
then you should start your own

1032
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,119
organization

1033
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,918
sure if you come on to some come on

1034
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,199
board with someone else

1035
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,359
you know you choose to volunteer or you

1036
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,879
choose to

1037
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,480
work for an organization and you're on

1038
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,119
boarding their ethos

1039
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,199
and representing what their movement is

1040
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,320
about

1041
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,520
you really have no right to say

1042
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,879
you shouldn't make the decisions

1043
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,960
sure sure so the idea is kind of

1044
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,320
do you think the baby should be some

1045
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,399
kind of i don't know

1046
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,839
um let's say a self-reflection with

1047
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:50,560
people who

1048
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,639
who join groups or who start to work

1049
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,639
with not just av but with any group

1050
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,280
really

1051
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,119
that if you are going to volunteer with

1052
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,960
a group um

1053
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,800
i guess you need to learn that maybe

1054
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,000
your ideas

1055
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,960
won't always be accepted by the current

1056
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,000
i don't know manager

1057
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,240
leader organizer of that group and if

1058
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,839
you don't like it then that's absolutely

1059
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,599
fine you either continue volunteering or

1060
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,160
you

1061
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
create your own thing and do it your way

1062
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,240
it's basically is that am i is that what

1063
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,119
you're saying basically

1064
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,359
what yeah because like of course we

1065
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,599
always welcome feedback but welcoming

1066
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:22,880
feedback doesn't mean we're going to

1067
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,400
take it on board

1068
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,119
we're going to discuss it between us too

1069
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,079
and then

1070
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,640
the team that we have and then we might

1071
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,880
take it on board or we may not

1072
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,599
but to expect that every single feedback

1073
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,520
is just going to be accepted and we're

1074
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,400
going to implement

1075
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,040
that idea whatever it might be i think

1076
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,520
that's

1077
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,280
very unrealistic yeah it will be very

1078
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,520
chaotic so yes if somebody doesn't like

1079
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,880
the fact that

1080
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,079
you know their feedback wasn't accepted

1081
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,520
then i think if they feel like

1082
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,200
they're not aligned with the

1083
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,880
organization then they should just do

1084
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,480
their own thing i mean that just makes

1085
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,240
sense to me it's just very common

1086
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,440
yeah and you know i think you clarified

1087
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,359
but just to make sure

1088
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,520
just to make sure that no one is

1089
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,680
confused by what we're saying here

1090
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,960
we're not saying you know if you if you

1091
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
have any input

1092
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,920
you know you have any feedback you have

1093
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,000
any criticism

1094
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,680
as a represent as a representative of ab

1095
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,040
whether you're an organizer volunteer

1096
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,040
we're not saying that we're just going

1097
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,599
to say [ __ ] you and go do your own thing

1098
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,480
that's not how we operate we and like to

1099
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,560
think that we've only ever

1100
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,599
enacted ideas that have come

1101
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,240
from either my brain or a cell's brain

1102
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,599
is insane

1103
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,720
we've always taken on feedback from

1104
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,839
others

1105
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,320
and taken it into account and i think

1106
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,160
the last thing i want people to consider

1107
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,599
here is

1108
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,640
where would ab be today

1109
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,880
like really think about where a baby

1110
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
would be today if we

1111
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,359
weren't operating the way that we are if

1112
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:07,359
we ran a system where we had like

1113
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,560
a board of um

1114
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,079
you know board of directors where we

1115
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,240
only had a vote

1116
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,040
into what was and we only had two votes

1117
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,720
of many

1118
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,079
into what was being decided on

1119
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,240
i mean i think it's i i think it's clear

1120
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,839
that av wouldn't be clear

1121
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,000
about the message and i don't think that

1122
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,480
we would be

1123
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,680
where we are today that leads on to

1124
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,119
another point quite nicely actually

1125
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,640
because i think what i feel like you're

1126
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,480
hinting at here is that that

1127
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,040
if you didn't maintain control you feel

1128
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,280
that av would go down the same road as

1129
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,119
pretty much every other ar organization

1130
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,280
has gone down where they are bringing in

1131
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,000
uh human issues um on human rights

1132
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,480
issues

1133
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,320
and basically kind of i guess

1134
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,920
i guess if i if you could put in a way

1135
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,760
that they're moving with the times

1136
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
rather than staying true to what they

1137
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,000
started for if that makes sense um and

1138
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,520
some people would say that that is a

1139
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
positive thing

1140
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,839
you know to move with the times because

1141
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,599
let's be honest the you know the the

1142
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,480
times

1143
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,040
are very much changing and you know a

1144
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,480
lot of human rights issues have

1145
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,400
very much been thrown to the front and

1146
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,240
that's not necessarily a bad thing

1147
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,880
um but you could argue that ar

1148
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,000
organizations

1149
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,800
also taking those fights on board is

1150
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,119
some

1151
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,720
some and i guess you would argue that is

1152
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,040
a bad thing and that brings me to

1153
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,079
another question that has been asked or

1154
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,520
let's say a topic that has been brought

1155
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:37,920
up

1156
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,960
uh the topic of anti-intersectionality

1157
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,359
and uh and you know what this means with

1158
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,720
with av what intersect or not

1159
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,000
intersectionality i don't think that's

1160
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,680
even the correct thing to talk

1161
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,200
to to say because i don't

1162
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,760
intersectionality itself i'm sure we all

1163
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,079
if there's anybody in this in this chat

1164
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,119
or even you guys

1165
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,440
that say disagrees with the concept of

1166
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,119
it i would just say you're disagreeing

1167
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,240
with facts right

1168
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,560
if the fact is that intersexuality as it

1169
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,000
was originally coined

1170
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,480
it's it's factual it's like you know

1171
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,160
someone who's female and black will

1172
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,359
experience the world differently to

1173
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,119
someone who's male and white or someone

1174
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,280
who's female and white or someone who's

1175
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,680
you know transgender and black or

1176
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,480
transgender and

1177
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,520
everyone experiences the world

1178
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,880
differently and has different challenges

1179
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,240
right that's what it means

1180
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
that's literally what it means not what

1181
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,440
vegans have made it that's

1182
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,839
[ __ ] so we all will agree that

1183
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,200
that's what it means i'm sure

1184
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,359
and i you know i guess no one really

1185
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,800
would would say it would argue against

1186
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,880
that it's just logic it's just factual

1187
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,440
but let's say uh the they call

1188
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,040
themselves consistent anti-oppression

1189
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,079
crowd let's say

1190
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,960
and and this is something that you have

1191
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,760
get

1192
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,119
like more than once you've stood out

1193
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,880
stood up against and you've said said

1194
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,839
some things about

1195
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,240
you know the animals first um approach

1196
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,079
non-humans first approach

1197
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,960
um and this has been widely criticized

1198
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,640
and a lot of people have even

1199
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,680
you know people make videos about this

1200
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,040
they are constantly attacking

1201
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,760
you guys for this they are people um

1202
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,599
saying they won't they won't go to av

1203
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,040
events because of this um so yeah

1204
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,920
this is the topic we're going to get

1205
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,839
into i'll ask you a question someone

1206
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,440
just asked this question earlier

1207
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,280
uh why do intersectionals

1208
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
intersectionals not like you

1209
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,560
that's what someone said so that's an

1210
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,079
easy question to start with why do these

1211
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,440
people hate you why are they coming for

1212
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:19,839
you

1213
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,119
why are they trying to cancel you why

1214
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,960
are they trying to ruin um your

1215
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,839
organization

1216
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,000
you want to go only um

1217
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,880
yeah i i guess yeah like you you already

1218
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,079
explained that

1219
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,359
it's not that we're anti-intersectional

1220
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,480
um we just made a decision that

1221
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,440
av is going to be 100 dedicated to the

1222
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,359
animals non-human animals

1223
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,560
and there are many reasons why we

1224
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,720
decided on that

1225
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,599
but that doesn't mean that we don't

1226
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,839
think or anyone within the organization

1227
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,319
not just

1228
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,680
us too doesn't believe that other groups

1229
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,920
of beings need

1230
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,640
um voices to speak up for them or we

1231
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,240
shouldn't be doing activism in different

1232
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,480
areas so it's again it's just the way

1233
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,839
that people

1234
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,800
decide to interpret this like someone

1235
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,160
decided that because

1236
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,680
av is 100 dedicated to non-human animals

1237
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,119
that means that

1238
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,400
we have hatred towards humans or

1239
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,880
we there's discrimination when it comes

1240
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
to certain groups of humans

1241
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
and they're just running with that idea

1242
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,359
i think it's

1243
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,520
easy to paint that image of us

1244
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,440
given that we are aware of the fact

1245
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,680
that we dedicate av 100 to animal rights

1246
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,359
in light of a temp

1247
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,480
the temperament currently in society is

1248
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:50,800
that

1249
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,040
anyone who does such a thing must also

1250
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,400
pander

1251
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,560
to human rights otherwise it's totally

1252
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,079
out of place so we're completely aware

1253
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,839
of this

1254
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,280
and we still won't pander so

1255
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,440
it's easy to paint us like that but we

1256
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,560
don't care because

1257
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,760
we want for this to exist in the world

1258
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,200
we want a movement who is still willing

1259
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,319
to just

1260
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,480
do the right thing in the face of what

1261
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,760
is popular in

1262
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,680
the moment and you've been also

1263
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,400
a popular thing that comes up when

1264
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
discussing these things is the the idea

1265
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,480
of a hierarchy of oppression

1266
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,960
of which it it appears that you that you

1267
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,520
guys

1268
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,240
do um have a hierarchy as in you i've

1269
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,200
heard at least

1270
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
you paul especially i've heard this but

1271
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,880
i don't know if i'm sure you've said it

1272
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,280
as well

1273
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,119
and this is not an attack it's just you

1274
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,319
know just quoting

1275
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,560
um that the animals are by far the most

1276
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,520
oppressed beings

1277
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,079
on the planet right and some people get

1278
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,440
upset about that because they say that

1279
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,720
you're creating a hierarchy of

1280
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,240
oppression and apparently this

1281
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,359
is this is uh this is wrong um how do

1282
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,599
you respond to that

1283
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,839
um that's disrespectful and it's a spit

1284
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,839
in the face of every animal that

1285
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,200
that is subjected to that injustice

1286
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,800
you know you can you can act like

1287
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,359
you're offended by these semantics all

1288
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,720
you want

1289
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
but just remember that while your

1290
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,319
charade is going on

1291
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,760
you're spitting in the face of the

1292
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,079
victims who are involved in the

1293
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,440
injustice that you're carrying on about

1294
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,400
and that's my response to that it's just

1295
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,480
simple that

1296
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,240
we shouldn't have to explain that we're

1297
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,400
not saying that humans aren't oppressed

1298
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,560
what you said doesn't sound like

1299
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,200
something

1300
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,680
that resonates with me the hierarchy of

1301
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,440
oppression

1302
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,359
but it is a fact that the animals

1303
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,079
well okay so in terms of the number of

1304
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,839
individual animals

1305
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,800
who have been tortured and abused and

1306
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,760
murdered

1307
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,680
compared to any other injustice that's

1308
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,160
literally what we're talking about so

1309
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,400
i don't think it's i don't think it

1310
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,720
means like if anyone takes that as

1311
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,119
so you're saying there is a hierarchy of

1312
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,119
oppression meaning

1313
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,280
this group is more oppressed or we

1314
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,280
should speak up for them first that's

1315
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,160
not what we're saying you can't take

1316
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,880
that from

1317
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,200
from saying you know animals are the

1318
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,160
most suppressed meaning they have been

1319
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,119
um they have been oppressed for the

1320
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,560
longest

1321
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
and the number of individual victims is

1322
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,640
higher than any other injustice that's

1323
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,480
just the fact that's the reality of it

1324
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,280
and

1325
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,200
you're right if somebody gets upset

1326
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,640
because of that

1327
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,560
then i think they need to just reflect

1328
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,560
on why that is because

1329
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,720
i know that there are people out there

1330
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,560
that were more oppressed than me

1331
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,319
as as a woman of color

1332
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,640
and so therefore anyone else in any

1333
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,599
other group then

1334
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,359
they should know that there are other

1335
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,359
beings you know that are more oppressed

1336
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,960
than themselves and that doesn't take

1337
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,760
away from their pain or their suffering

1338
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,200
that's how i see it i mean how

1339
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,440
more audacious could you possibly be

1340
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,240
as a human being any human being

1341
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,359
to say you're more oppressed than a

1342
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,839
group of beings

1343
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,599
enslaved tortured and murdered

1344
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,119
by the trillion with a t every

1345
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,760
year when was the last genocide of one

1346
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
billion with a b

1347
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,960
humans oh wait

1348
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,079
crickets a billion

1349
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,880
i'm talking three trillion with a t

1350
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,960
are subjected to this injustice every

1351
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,000
single year

1352
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,920
it's happening every second of every day

1353
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,520
doesn't need to be explained to vegans

1354
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,839
of course

1355
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,560
but hello don't get mad at us for being

1356
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,440
a medium of truth

1357
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,400
yeah i think um just to add to that i

1358
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,480
think this is this is a point that i

1359
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,560
i agree on i mean i'm i guess i'm not

1360
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,000
supposed to be sharing my personal views

1361
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,760
here i am interviewing you but i have to

1362
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,200
say i agree with you because

1363
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,599
um i don't believe that it's down to

1364
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,119
emotions at this point i believe it's

1365
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,079
down to the facts

1366
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,960
and it's objectively true it's it's it's

1367
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,640
not something that can even be argued

1368
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,319
against and anyone who's tried to argue

1369
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:28,800
against

1370
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,800
even with me the arguments it just falls

1371
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,079
to pieces because

1372
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,240
you can't possibly claim that any other

1373
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,079
animal on the planet is abused

1374
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,400
well any human animal on the planet is

1375
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,599
abused or or

1376
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,160
exploited or objectified more than a

1377
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,480
non-human the non-humans don't even have

1378
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,720
political rights or voices like it's

1379
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,560
it's not even about how much they say

1380
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,079
even if we forget how many of them are

1381
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,000
abused in the severity the fact that

1382
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,319
they

1383
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,119
literally have no say at all in their

1384
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,400
own lives

1385
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,200
um like none none whatsoever no legal

1386
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,720
almost no legal rights

1387
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,680
you know um it's it's enough you know

1388
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,200
it's enough to just even go from that

1389
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,720
even if it wasn't three trillion

1390
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,880
that alone is enough of a point you know

1391
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,240
but at that and

1392
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,160
the fact there's three trillion of them

1393
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,480
being you know horrifically

1394
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,720
murdered it's it's it's yeah it's a

1395
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,079
crazy point to try to

1396
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:19,760
to try to argue against that in my

1397
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,520
opinion and i'm always surprised when

1398
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,559
vegans try to argue against it it's i

1399
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,160
mean nothing really surprises me anymore

1400
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,040
actually

1401
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,280
but but yeah it's slightly more

1402
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,160
surprised

1403
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,440
with that um i've got a question uh

1404
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,400
do you think this is this came from a a

1405
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:36,880
uh

1406
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,040
instagramer i think uh do you think it's

1407
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,200
speciesist to ignore human oppression

1408
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,359
while fighting for non-human animals

1409
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,559
that was that was a question that

1410
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,839
somebody wanted to ask you guys

1411
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,920
you know i know that people aren't

1412
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,119
attuned to

1413
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,559
nuance and context but

1414
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,800
it is required for us to answer this

1415
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,920
question

1416
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,960
uh as a general statement yeah like

1417
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,599
the way you ask that of course not like

1418
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:06,319
yeah

1419
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,800
sorry the question was is it is it

1420
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,160
speciesist

1421
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,079
do you think it yeah do you think it is

1422
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,839
personally do you find it to be

1423
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,680
is that is that an example of speciesism

1424
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,880
basically yes

1425
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,280
when i hear that question as a blanket

1426
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,520
statement like that yes

1427
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,920
because it sounds like otherwise

1428
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,760
otherwise you're denying

1429
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,000
that group of things like their

1430
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,680
existence and their suffering and their

1431
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,559
oppression

1432
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,000
so yeah of course it is but yeah like we

1433
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,319
need an example or an explanation of why

1434
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,839
because

1435
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,800
is that because again because av is 100

1436
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,720
focused on non-human animals

1437
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,200
or is this question directed at us

1438
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,960
personally and people are wondering if

1439
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,200
we do other forms of activism where we

1440
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,880
care about other poison

1441
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,839
forms of injustice every every day we

1442
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,760
make a post on social media about

1443
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,880
non-human animals

1444
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,839
every day we set up cube of truth action

1445
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:05,520
on the streets

1446
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,960
those energies are spent on fighting for

1447
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,880
non-human animals while

1448
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,079
human injustices are occurring within

1449
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,319
human human to human injustices are

1450
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,880
occurring around the world

1451
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,520
at that time so if at a general level

1452
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,680
you want to say because of our answer

1453
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,119
we're technically ignoring

1454
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,880
all of these other injustices while

1455
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,440
we're doing that well

1456
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,920
there's no such there's no point of even

1457
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,720
trying to

1458
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,920
like there's no nuance at all

1459
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,359
in the way that someone would think if

1460
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,839
that's the conclusion they're trying

1461
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,559
yeah yeah i think i would add to that

1462
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:44,880
and

1463
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,720
i don't think it's speciesism because

1464
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,920
you're not uh

1465
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,839
you're not not fighting for humans i'm

1466
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:51,839
not i'm not not fighting for humans

1467
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,200
because i think humans are somehow

1468
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,000
inferior

1469
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,520
i'm choosing to fight for non-humans

1470
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,280
because i believe that well not i

1471
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,559
believe they are

1472
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:01,280
um in more need simple as that so that's

1473
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:01,599
my

1474
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,680
how i answer that question is is that

1475
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,359
way it's not speciesism because i'm not

1476
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:06,960
doing it because of the species

1477
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,720
i'm doing it because of the severity of

1478
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,000
the situation

1479
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,319
we've never even said the term animals

1480
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,839
first human second

1481
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,000
like that's come from other people we've

1482
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,200
never said that before

1483
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,280
right right what we've never said is

1484
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,960
animals deserve to have a cause

1485
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,160
dedicated

1486
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,680
solely to them and so av

1487
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,400
will be that

1488
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,800
sure i actually i i don't know if i've

1489
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,240
ever heard you say that i don't think i

1490
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,440
don't think i have and something but

1491
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:33,839
some

1492
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,760
people have messaged that so if anyone's

1493
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,040
watching right now and you

1494
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,800
you feel like you have some evidence of

1495
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,640
that then you're more than welcome to

1496
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,079
send it and we'll discuss it and

1497
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,400
you know but i i yeah it's it's

1498
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,599
something that does keep coming up and

1499
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,200
that goes for other things by the way

1500
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,760
if you're watching now and we we go

1501
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,559
through something and

1502
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:53,200
and you know but we discuss our this

1503
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,640
i've never said that or this has not

1504
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,200
happened

1505
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,440
and you think it has you just send me a

1506
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,960
message with what you think has happened

1507
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,480
or within with evidence of it and we'll

1508
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,240
we'll talk about it right now we're not

1509
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,240
we're not here to hide away from things

1510
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,160
and you know paul and us how you agreed

1511
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,079
to come on here to actually

1512
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,760
directly face some of these things you

1513
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,680
know so if anyone does have something

1514
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,280
that they feel should be directly faced

1515
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,520
just send it me on instagram or

1516
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,040
messenger or email um or you know tag

1517
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,480
tag me in the comments and tell me

1518
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,760
you're gonna send it on messenger or

1519
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,040
whatever and i'll and i'll pick it up

1520
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,280
and

1521
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,319
we'll bring it up on the screen and

1522
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,839
we'll talk about it like we're not we're

1523
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,280
not hiding anything but

1524
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,880
i've got a sneaky suspicion that that's

1525
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,559
not gonna happen because

1526
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,000
most of the stuff we're talking about is

1527
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,839
just rumor and you know

1528
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,040
it's i don't think there's a lot of

1529
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,880
evidence behind it to be honest

1530
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,079
um yeah but um let's

1531
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,280
let's i think we're still on

1532
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,599
intersectionality and

1533
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,119
i think i feel like we maybe want to

1534
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,319
delve into that just a little bit

1535
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:47,119
further

1536
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,400
um i guess what i guess your guys stance

1537
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,760
on it i mean somebody asked the question

1538
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,720
here saying

1539
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,040
what are you doing to make your activism

1540
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,800
intersectional somebody asked that

1541
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,520
uh of you guys and and i was thinking

1542
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,200
like how can i really ask that because i

1543
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,240
don't i don't i don't know if it's

1544
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,680
something that you actually are trying

1545
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:04,400
to do

1546
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,880
um i don't i know that there was a i

1547
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,480
know there was a change of direction

1548
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,680
recently as to i don't know not be so

1549
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,119
i don't know what the word is to be more

1550
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,800
sensitive i think with your own words

1551
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,319
um because maybe in the past there was a

1552
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,160
little bit of insensitivity but i guess

1553
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,640
yeah

1554
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,760
what would you say to someone who's

1555
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,920
asking you that how what are you doing

1556
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,119
to make your activism more

1557
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,880
intersectional

1558
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,680
we're not trying to do that like you

1559
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,079
said

1560
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,440
but that's not the goal there's no need

1561
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,119
for us to

1562
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,280
try to do that and let's just cut the

1563
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,160
[ __ ] here

1564
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,319
people who say this are not actually

1565
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,599
asking us

1566
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,040
to adopt anti-oppression values within

1567
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,640
our organization because

1568
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,440
we already have those what they're

1569
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,640
asking us to do

1570
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,480
is become activists for human related

1571
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,040
issues

1572
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,960
and we are dedicated to non-human

1573
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,240
animals

1574
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,680
sorry not sorry so you draw

1575
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,599
you draw a line i guess uh between

1576
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,839
not contributing to other oppressions

1577
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,160
are they drawing a line sorry between

1578
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,839
not contributing to other oppressions

1579
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,000
and being active for other oppressions

1580
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,680
and they feel that because

1581
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,000
you are on the not contributing side of

1582
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,760
the line that therefore means that you

1583
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:18,079
are

1584
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,920
wrong and that you should be actually

1585
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
active for those oppressions too correct

1586
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,200
they want us to be on the streets

1587
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,640
showing footage of

1588
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,559
what's happening in the blm movement or

1589
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,839
with regards to homelessness or feminism

1590
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,680
or i guess whatever the mainstream issue

1591
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,800
is of the times

1592
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,960
but going back to what you were saying

1593
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,480
earlier about

1594
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,440
like the definition of intersectionality

1595
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,160
it actually

1596
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,359
doesn't apply here because

1597
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,720
sure you can be an animal rights

1598
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,480
activist you can also be

1599
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,319
a human rights activist in what that

1600
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,000
whatever area you want to

1601
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,240
work in but um what's the relationship

1602
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,119
between

1603
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,480
like any of those things that you

1604
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,319
mentioned and animals

1605
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:04,960
suffering you know what i mean there is

1606
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,079
no relationship so

1607
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,440
i i don't think it actually makes sense

1608
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,559
to ask that of us

1609
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,240
so how are we gonna make it work with

1610
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,079
that even if that was something we were

1611
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,160
looking at doing how are you gonna

1612
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,920
connect homelessness to animal suffering

1613
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,920
in the median egg industry

1614
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,280
we get asked to speak up about various

1615
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,000
issues

1616
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,280
and it is really only about what is

1617
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,280
popular at that time what is being

1618
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,280
spoken about at that time

1619
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,839
and it's not about these issues that

1620
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:42,640
cause

1621
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,760
a vast number of deaths around the world

1622
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,799
for example in

1623
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,640
the middle east that never gets spoken

1624
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,319
about that we're aware of because we

1625
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:55,760
have heritage in the middle east

1626
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,559
we know about these things these people

1627
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,559
for example who were outraged about what

1628
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:01,920
was going on

1629
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,760
in america during the protests in

1630
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,359
minnesota and throughout

1631
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,240
other states said really nothing about

1632
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,520
what happened in lebanon

1633
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,520
for example yeah they are very selective

1634
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,400
yeah the causes that they choose to

1635
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,480
speak up about and that's the thing

1636
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,599
because when people ask us to do the

1637
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,400
same thing

1638
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,200
they're asking us to to speak up for

1639
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,319
those specific

1640
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,559
issues um because you know how

1641
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,319
many different things are out there that

1642
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,079
you could be speaking about when it

1643
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,680
comes to human rights

1644
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,799
there are so many different things and i

1645
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:39,280
don't know

1646
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,960
anyone who claims to be an

1647
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,559
intersectional and

1648
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,440
they actually cover all of those issues

1649
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,720
there's literally

1650
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,400
thousands of different things that you

1651
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,920
could talk about and i

1652
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,640
i only see these people focusing on two

1653
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,400
or three different categories and they

1654
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,520
want us to do the same

1655
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,440
and that points out that you do have to

1656
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,799
choose your cause

1657
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,040
yeah because if they're claiming you

1658
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,559
have to speak up for all of them

1659
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,319
well there's literally thousands of

1660
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,920
injustices occurring right now

1661
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,040
around the world all the time so

1662
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,119
it's not only impractical it's

1663
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,400
impossible

1664
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,480
for you to physically pull that off to

1665
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,599
actually speak up for

1666
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,599
all of them yeah and to fight

1667
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,799
to end all of them all at once i mean

1668
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,079
think about how insane that is so these

1669
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,520
people are being hypocrites

1670
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,760
because these people are choosing their

1671
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,799
causes

1672
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,680
which is guess what we have you have our

1673
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,559
support

1674
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,720
you have our full support to do that

1675
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,480
because we chose a cause

1676
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,000
yeah and that's how it is you guys are

1677
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,760
doing the same thing that we're doing

1678
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,760
how about we i'm actually taking this

1679
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,920
moment to see where we have

1680
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,040
something in common and maybe you

1681
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,559
should do the same thing instead of

1682
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,400
looking at where we have a difference or

1683
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,359
where you think you're more holier than

1684
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,000
that

1685
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,040
or something to that effect have you

1686
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,319
considered this before

1687
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,559
there's a concept that actually if i

1688
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,599
i'll tell you who who

1689
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,440
introduced me to it but um this was

1690
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,799
actually back in the day when things

1691
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,000
were a little bit nicer but it was

1692
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,040
actually anita

1693
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,960
who introduced me to this concept um

1694
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,880
years like maybe a year and a half ago

1695
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,240
two years ago when i

1696
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,480
i brought up the i brought up some

1697
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,079
comments about insectionality and i kind

1698
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,000
of warned anita that it looked like this

1699
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,440
was going to start to take a turn for

1700
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,000
the worse

1701
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,160
people were starting to attack me for

1702
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,359
not you know saying

1703
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,119
certain things or for saying certain

1704
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,640
things and i felt like it was starting

1705
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,160
to seep into organizations and i

1706
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,119
mentioned this and

1707
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,319
she told me we won't do this because we

1708
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,520
are all about positive

1709
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,280
intersectionality and she had this

1710
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,960
concept and this mindset and it really

1711
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,799
inspired me actually because she said

1712
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,240
we can fight for the animals 100 always

1713
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,720
but when there are situations where it

1714
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,319
also benefits humans

1715
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,280
we can also note it for example look

1716
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,599
these

1717
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,160
vegans went out and gave free food to

1718
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,359
the homeless because

1719
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,680
they're suffering they're doing animal

1720
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,440
rights activism by teaching the homeless

1721
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,400
about veganism

1722
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,079
and they're helping the homeless for

1723
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,599
example that would be a positive

1724
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,079
intersectional message right it's not no

1725
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:11,839
one loses out here the animals are

1726
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,480
focused

1727
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,520
and the the homeless people have a focus

1728
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,760
in lebanon for example with the blast

1729
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,240
the the vegans the local vegans

1730
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,240
were doing incredible work they were

1731
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,079
getting like food out to everyone they

1732
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:24,799
were like

1733
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,960
you know um helping the vegan businesses

1734
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,920
in the area they were helping the

1735
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,200
animals in the area it was it was

1736
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,079
amazing

1737
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,160
but you're also raising awareness of

1738
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,920
that corrupt government and how this

1739
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,440
even happened in the first place

1740
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,400
it's it's two in one it's easy right um

1741
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,839
and this was great when she said this i

1742
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:40,960
was really inspired but obviously we

1743
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,640
know how that went and it didn't end up

1744
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,359
staying

1745
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,760
um staying that way unfortunately but

1746
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,200
for you guys like what do you think

1747
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,799
about av in that sense do you think this

1748
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,319
is something av could do

1749
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:52,079
like with social media i mean not with

1750
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,520
the cubes but like with how you

1751
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,040
represent yourselves on social media is

1752
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,640
that something that you've thought about

1753
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,720
or would ever consider or you do you

1754
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,559
have do you disagree with that that kind

1755
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:00,880
of

1756
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,280
way of doing things

1757
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,960
what way of doing things specifically

1758
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,799
what is being suggested

1759
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,559
so so like for example when there are

1760
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,000
some um

1761
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,920
when there is there are issues that

1762
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,480
potentially could be both benefited by

1763
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,400
raising awareness of it for example you

1764
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,079
obviously av is 100 focused on the

1765
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,520
animals but let's imagine

1766
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,000
there is uh some of your av organizers

1767
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,880
or your av

1768
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,480
team goes out and gives food to the

1769
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,720
homeless raising putting that on av

1770
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,760
social media

1771
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,440
and saying like look look look at what

1772
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,200
our awesome activists are doing they're

1773
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,559
fighting for the animals and they're

1774
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:35,520
helping the homeless

1775
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,440
do you see some pro a problem with doing

1776
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,040
something like that or do you think that

1777
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,599
that you agree with that as a as an idea

1778
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,040
that specific suggestion

1779
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,599
just sounds like we would be

1780
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,720
i don't see how that helps

1781
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:54,000
a human cause of any kind by making a

1782
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,119
post like that

1783
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,200
i don't see that as activism to help a

1784
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,960
human cause

1785
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,880
i mean at best it's congratulatory and

1786
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,079
supportive of individuals within our

1787
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,559
network who are doing that

1788
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,799
uh

1789
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,839
i don't see that as activism though i

1790
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,760
didn't see that as like fighting a human

1791
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,480
rights cause of some kind

1792
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,960
no i guess not but i guess it would be

1793
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,319
raising awareness that

1794
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,000
homeless people need food i know people

1795
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,079
know that or maybe inspiring other

1796
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,000
vegans to go out and outreach

1797
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,599
homeless people and give them food i

1798
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,040
don't know it's an idea it's just it's

1799
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,040
just an idea is what i mean it's it's

1800
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,480
something that uh

1801
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,400
um like i don't know if it even would

1802
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,079
count as intersectionality in that case

1803
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,280
but for example the

1804
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,920
lebanon example would because they they

1805
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,119
have the corrupt government they are

1806
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,640
they're oppressing their people

1807
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,119
um making someone making a post or

1808
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,400
making a video on that where you're

1809
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,520
saying hey look at what these awesome

1810
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,480
vegans are doing

1811
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,920
they're fighting a corrupt government

1812
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,200
and they're also saving animals and

1813
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,400
they're getting people food

1814
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,640
that that would be a better example of

1815
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,480
of how to raise awareness of

1816
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,440
two oppressions um in one without either

1817
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,000
of them

1818
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,599
losing anything if that makes sense

1819
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,599
because it's not like we're just talking

1820
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:06,240
about

1821
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,760
you know lebanon we're talking about

1822
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,240
vegan and activists in lebanon so like

1823
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,040
then it becomes

1824
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,960
something that encompasses all of it you

1825
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,720
know but i mean i

1826
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,319
i'm a bit confused because

1827
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,400
i don't see how it was like an animal

1828
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,319
rights

1829
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:25,359
uh thing that they did

1830
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,760
they're just vegans people who don't

1831
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:29,359
abuse and torture animals

1832
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,720
animal rights activists who went and did

1833
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:36,319
a deed for humans and that deed

1834
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,680
was a human rights good

1835
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,319
that they did and when they were doing

1836
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,680
that

1837
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,079
that act that deed had nothing to do

1838
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,280
with the animals really

1839
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,960
it was just about i think david was

1840
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,240
saying that they were kind of

1841
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,040
outreaching

1842
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,720
people when they were giving them the

1843
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,079
food were they

1844
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:55,760
yeah i believe they were i don't know

1845
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,520
this for sure but i believe they were

1846
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,039
sending out like leaflets and stuff with

1847
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:00,880
the with the bags and also they were

1848
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,400
rescuing animals too they were actually

1849
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,760
rescuing animals off the street and

1850
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,799
getting them treated

1851
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,720
they were raising money for that too so

1852
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,240
they were doing a few yeah it was like

1853
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:08,880
uh

1854
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,319
it was yeah they were doing a few little

1855
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:11,760
a few different things to try and help

1856
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,240
the animals and also the people

1857
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,920
yeah i didn't know the full extent of

1858
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,520
the campaign that they carried out over

1859
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,319
there

1860
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,559
uh i all i know is at the time i reached

1861
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,000
out and you know i checked in with them

1862
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,640
and i

1863
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,920
was just wanting to know if they were

1864
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,680
okay during the whole blast

1865
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,880
but i forgive my ignorance to

1866
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,680
those who were carrying out that awesome

1867
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,599
campaign because it looked very

1868
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,440
helpful i was just confused on how it

1869
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,960
was tied into animal rights i just

1870
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,160
thought they were

1871
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,240
doing a deed a good deed for humans in

1872
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,000
that moment

1873
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
i didn't see how maybe they were maybe

1874
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,599
they were maybe they were maybe maybe

1875
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,119
they were only doing that some of them

1876
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,280
um but i know for sure some of them were

1877
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,799
also rescuing the animals i guess

1878
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,680
i mean with a more concrete example if

1879
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,960
let's imagine there is a concrete

1880
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,480
example of this where they're actually

1881
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,359
doing that

1882
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,200
they're actually advocating for animal

1883
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,119
rights whilst simultaneously helping

1884
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,000
humans

1885
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,640
um i guess the question is like would

1886
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,119
would

1887
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,760
that be something av would consider to

1888
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,720
post about if

1889
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,960
it came up or or is is there some a

1890
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,400
reason not to that's what i'm trying to

1891
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:12,960
understand

1892
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,440
like hosting so you're asking

1893
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,960
specifically about posting about it on

1894
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,440
social media

1895
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,359
our platforms are for animal rights for

1896
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,119
non-human animal rights

1897
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,599
so that's our general response to that

1898
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:26,559
but we do

1899
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,240
carry out what you're saying we do

1900
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,520
take the opportunity to how did you want

1901
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:33,920
it

1902
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,920
to benefit humans while benefiting the

1903
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,160
animals you know in those moments when

1904
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:38,799
we see

1905
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:40,720
any form of oppression or discrimination

1906
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,960
occurring within our organization

1907
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,720
we stamp it out with the quickness and

1908
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,960
we have a process that we go through

1909
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,000
to rid it from the organization

1910
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,240
in those moments we're taking action

1911
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,440
that benefits humans and the animals

1912
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,119
we're just not posting about it i guess

1913
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,640
because our platforms

1914
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,760
and network is for non-human animals

1915
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,680
okay i understand i understand so it's

1916
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,760
kind of like um

1917
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,400
yeah so your base your base kind of um i

1918
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,160
don't know what to put it here

1919
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,520
your let's say default your your focus

1920
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,039
your

1921
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,119
baseline i keep using that word is is

1922
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,160
that you know the

1923
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,799
the account is for non-humans and that

1924
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:21,680
that's kind of the be

1925
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,440
that's it basically that that's how it's

1926
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,280
going to be like social media

1927
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,960
and also the cubes it that that's where

1928
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,920
it's going to stay

1929
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,920
and that that's your core kind of value

1930
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,200
basically that's what you're saying here

1931
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,880
right

1932
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,319
yeah like again going back to the

1933
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,079
numbers thing you know three trillion

1934
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,599
animals every year if you think about

1935
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:40,000
the amount

1936
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,680
of victims that are involved in this

1937
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,200
injustice you know how many more times

1938
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,680
uh more urgent would you say in terms of

1939
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,720
the numbers

1940
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,440
this injustice is than other injustices

1941
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:51,760
on

1942
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,079
the planet how many more times more

1943
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,520
urgent would you say

1944
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,440
totally it's like it's not a it's not a

1945
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,960
criticism for me i'm actually just

1946
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,240
trying to uh you know

1947
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,440
clarify yeah no no maybe that

1948
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,839
was framed like i was like being

1949
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:06,559
defensive

1950
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,240
but i'm asking a genuine question

1951
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,359
because my next thing i was going to say

1952
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:14,640
because i say that to say this

1953
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:20,079
like that's how much more

1954
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:22,960
urgent it is for us to maintain a focus

1955
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,799
on using those platforms for that reason

1956
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,559
so it's not you know okay

1957
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,079
yeah totally i i don't i don't see

1958
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:32,480
it as a a negative the reason i got into

1959
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,319
this this discussion now is because i

1960
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,079
i personally i i see some benefit in

1961
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,680
that for myself personally that's why i

1962
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,039
make some of the videos i make where i

1963
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:40,079
talk about

1964
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,400
vegans doing good work also for people i

1965
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,400
see some benefit in it and and that's my

1966
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:44,880
choice

1967
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,640
but that doesn't by default mean that

1968
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,920
your choice is wrong

1969
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,839
and i think this is um it's very

1970
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,280
important for anyone that watched this

1971
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,480
section and thinks

1972
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,240
oh but you know but some people are

1973
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,119
going to agree with you and they'll be

1974
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,799
like no keep keep the people off

1975
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,880
right i just just keep keep it really

1976
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,240
really focused and some people are going

1977
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,599
to agree with me and say well

1978
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,960
there's no harm in doing this and maybe

1979
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,720
it will help and that's totally fine to

1980
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,079
have different opinions

1981
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,640
um it doesn't mean one of us is wrong

1982
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,400
and deserves to be cancelled and the

1983
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,039
others

1984
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,960
are you know deserve to be celebrated

1985
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,960
it's just you align with who you align

1986
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,240
with and if you're aligned with paul and

1987
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,599
asylum this then you

1988
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,200
great keep you do that for your page and

1989
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,440
if you align with me then great you do

1990
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:22,720
what i said and if you don't align with

1991
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,400
either of us then i don't know alive

1992
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,440
with someone else and do

1993
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,520
do that then it's it's not um this isn't

1994
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,880
a case of being right or wrong i just

1995
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,400
wanted to see what you thought about it

1996
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,200
on this specific example the specific

1997
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,000
topic

1998
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,920
okay cool um let's let's uh

1999
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,359
all right let's go to a more direct

2000
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,599
thing then because i've got a few like

2001
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,920
let's say more direct accusations direct

2002
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,039
uh rumors

2003
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,839
and um we talked about humans quite a

2004
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:48,400
lot now

2005
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,720
and actually um it's kind of shitty that

2006
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,480
i bring the co-founders of anonymous for

2007
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,839
the voiceless on and we just talk about

2008
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,640
people

2009
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,640
but um that's what we came here for uh

2010
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,920
maybe we can do another live stream

2011
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,599
where we actually get into the

2012
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,920
you know into animal rights and activism

2013
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,839
and really you know go for that i think

2014
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:04,960
that would be nice to do

2015
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:07,760
um to kind of balance having to talk

2016
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:08,799
about this

2017
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:12,319
for such a long time but um

2018
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,839
these uh main accusations we've had and

2019
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,119
this also comes in with the

2020
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,640
intersectionality and also comes in with

2021
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,240
the things you just discussed about your

2022
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,760
uh your policies

2023
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,400
um the number one that came up multiple

2024
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,280
times was

2025
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,240
accusations of transphobia and pronouns

2026
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:28,640
and

2027
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,799
you've dealt with this uh obviously paul

2028
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,559
you've dealt with this personally and

2029
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:32,880
you've

2030
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,039
spoken about this in other places but we

2031
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,039
are going to talk about it a bit here

2032
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,079
and some specific

2033
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,839
questions um somebody's asked the

2034
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,160
question

2035
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,240
uh well i'll go for like the longer one

2036
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,359
actually there's a few questions but

2037
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,799
this one's actually quite a well

2038
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,200
written one so they said and they left

2039
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,520
av this individual because

2040
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,799
um because apparently av was focusing on

2041
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,319
they said focusing on the animals

2042
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,160
instead of encouraging respect between

2043
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,119
activists

2044
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,160
uh they said that there was a situation

2045
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,039
where you guys decided to call people by

2046
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,160
birth names

2047
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,599
rather than calling people by their

2048
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,520
preferred pronouns and for them

2049
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,559
this was extremely offensive and wrong

2050
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,440
um and the discussion around the pronoun

2051
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,359
politics or what you called uh

2052
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,359
i think you call it something like uh

2053
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:20,640
identity politics

2054
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,279
um they found this to be a lot of people

2055
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,040
i guess found this to be

2056
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,880
controversial or controversial enough

2057
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,719
for them to leave av

2058
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,839
or at least not go to cubes anymore so

2059
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,000
i guess the question is um why

2060
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
why why is that why is this decision

2061
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,520
been made to

2062
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,000
not use people's pronouns and use their

2063
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,600
first names instead

2064
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,920
even if they want to be referred to by a

2065
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,319
pronoun

2066
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,839
i guess i'll answer because there's our

2067
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,600
main interaction yeah

2068
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,319
uh gender pronouns are clearly

2069
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,399
ideological

2070
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:05,279
and uh we don't

2071
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,279
so you're just specifically asking about

2072
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,479
the cubes

2073
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,359
like in nab i guess yeah let's keep it

2074
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:12,960
focused on like cubes av

2075
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,640
yeah yeah so

2076
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,238
i've never like

2077
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:22,158
personally being asked to refer to

2078
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,759
someone as

2079
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,439
a particular like

2080
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:31,279
name and uh

2081
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,679
where where i've refused to call them

2082
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,040
that name that's never happened

2083
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,839
you know it's obviously the polite thing

2084
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:40,479
to do

2085
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:45,040
to use the requested name of someone

2086
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,600
but at cubes we don't even really need

2087
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,279
your name

2088
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,439
so it makes no sense for us to apply a

2089
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,319
protocol

2090
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,600
regarding one's gender

2091
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,280
so we don't even have a protocol

2092
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,800
regarding gender at all

2093
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,159
because it's not required it's

2094
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,199
we barely need your name at the cube and

2095
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,320
uh and

2096
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,320
that's what we said regarding this whole

2097
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,600
thing

2098
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,480
yeah so if if like putting this into

2099
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,159
real life like if someone actually

2100
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:19,360
did uh come to a cube and uh

2101
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,440
let's say it was it was one of your

2102
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,120
organizers or you whichever

2103
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,320
and they said okay i when you refer to

2104
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:26,640
me

2105
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,120
as like you know if if they are like

2106
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,719
doing something and that you're talking

2107
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:31,280
about them

2108
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,719
like they can't hear you or whatever or

2109
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:33,760
maybe they're in the conversation

2110
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,600
whatever they want to be referred to as

2111
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,400
a she

2112
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,360
um because now they're a trans woman and

2113
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,719
and is that something that you would

2114
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:42,000
respect

2115
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,360
or you would tell your organizers to

2116
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,040
respect or would you tell them no

2117
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,960
only refer to them by their name like

2118
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,520
that's his name but if if by respect

2119
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,679
you mean are we going to then call them

2120
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,719
a man in their face in order to make a

2121
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:57,280
point

2122
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,239
that we reject the notion that they

2123
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:02,000
identify as a woman

2124
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,600
well of course we're not going to do

2125
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,320
that that that would be impolite

2126
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,880
and counterproductive for our mission on

2127
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,719
the streets to begin with

2128
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:13,120
which is to get on with non-human animal

2129
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,560
rights activism

2130
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,679
not get caught up in issues between

2131
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:18,960
humans human centric

2132
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,159
issues and the reason why i'm pointing

2133
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,040
out

2134
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,880
that i initially started with pointing

2135
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,040
out that

2136
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,840
this is clearly ideological is that we

2137
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,080
don't allow any other

2138
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,159
political ideologies to be carried out

2139
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,840
or political agendas to be carried out

2140
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,440
at the cubes

2141
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,840
of any kind so when we've never

2142
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,239
specifically targeted this

2143
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:45,280
in any way you know it's just across the

2144
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,840
board not welcome

2145
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,600
sure and what what what about in the

2146
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,640
case that someone doesn't actually

2147
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,640
believe or doesn't really agree with you

2148
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,000
that it's political because a lot

2149
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,719
of people who are become become a trans

2150
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,159
woman or a trans man

2151
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,920
they don't do it out of some political

2152
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,679
ideology they do it because they have

2153
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,440
gender dysphoria right it's a medical

2154
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,320
condition

2155
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,719
and them being referred to as a he or

2156
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:07,440
she

2157
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,719
um it's nothing to do with their

2158
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:10,480
politics is to do with them being

2159
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,640
like validated as a person right so it's

2160
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,760
actually really important

2161
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,520
i know i know there are a lot of trans

2162
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,960
activists out there who are making this

2163
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,400
very very political i understand that

2164
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,440
they exist

2165
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,800
and there are people who are not even

2166
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,120
trans who make it political by

2167
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,880
forcing others to call them a he or she

2168
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,320
when they've they don't have gender

2169
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,600
dysphoria you know what i mean i

2170
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,960
understand this is happening

2171
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,199
and i understand standing up to that but

2172
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,320
in the case where these people are

2173
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,360
genuine

2174
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,480
um and you know they are asking as a

2175
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,719
as like a you know as a courtesy to help

2176
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:39,840
them adapt to

2177
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,560
this new life for example would that be

2178
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,520
a policy of av

2179
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,520
to to tell people right you refer to

2180
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:48,320
them as they want to be referred to or

2181
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,239
is that not a policy navy and it's no

2182
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:51,920
you just you call them by name and

2183
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,320
that's it

2184
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,840
so just to clarify here because i think

2185
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,440
there's some things being communicated

2186
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,880
that

2187
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,880
in this interaction that might lead

2188
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,560
people to think that we've commented on

2189
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,840
trans people when we haven't even

2190
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,120
commented on trans people

2191
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:10,400
at all ever ever

2192
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,719
uh my comments were only about gender

2193
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,400
pronouns

2194
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,560
and uh gender pronouns are a completely

2195
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,320
different discussion

2196
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,920
to trans issues gender pronouns are

2197
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:23,920
used by people who don't even identify

2198
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,199
as trans

2199
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,920
so i'm not talking about trans people

2200
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,360
i've never talked i've never said

2201
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,880
anything about trans people and neither

2202
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,000
is a cell

2203
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,320
and that needs to be clarified 100 i

2204
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,840
think because

2205
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,840
i don't appreciate getting tossed into

2206
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,760
that category of someone who has spoken

2207
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,360
about trans people when i haven't said a

2208
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,280
single word about trans people

2209
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,560
uh my comments are about my skepticism

2210
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,640
towards gender pronouns and the use of

2211
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,400
gender pronouns and then being

2212
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,320
50 plus gender pronouns that was my

2213
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,040
comment

2214
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:59,840
and uh this like i said at the cube

2215
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,239
there's no real need for even

2216
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,360
even for someone's name so if if

2217
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,760
this is happening this interaction is

2218
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:08,960
happening at a cube

2219
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,640
where someone is offended because you

2220
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,840
haven't used their correct gender

2221
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,400
pronoun

2222
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,560
that's what i mean by becoming political

2223
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,400
and someone bringing a political agenda

2224
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,360
into

2225
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,080
that space when we don't even really

2226
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:22,800
require

2227
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,280
your name so if that discussion is

2228
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:26,640
occurring at the cube it's likely

2229
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,320
because someone is choosing

2230
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,159
to make a rise out of it and you know to

2231
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,080
uh to you know

2232
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,320
obviously if someone is like i said

2233
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,199
already

2234
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:40,719
going out of their way to disrespect

2235
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,640
somebody like this yes we would take

2236
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,840
issue with that 100

2237
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,760
we would see that as bullying it would

2238
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,040
be implied and it would be

2239
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,560
bullying to say no i don't

2240
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,920
not only do i not believe what you

2241
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,480
believe but your belief is stupid

2242
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,760
that's bullying right so of course we

2243
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,239
don't condone that

2244
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,199
but at the same time forcing others to

2245
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,719
believe what you believe at the cube is

2246
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:05,760
not welcome

2247
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,280
that's not what we're there for right

2248
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,840
everybody has a different belief system

2249
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,520
when it comes to this topic

2250
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,040
and people are entitled to have

2251
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,719
different opinions about this

2252
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,239
and that's it's not a time and a space

2253
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,760
at a cube of truth

2254
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,040
to be fighting each other to be engaging

2255
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,000
in this kind of

2256
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,040
discord when it's human-centric

2257
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,480
and we are supposed to be there for

2258
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,320
non-human animals we should be

2259
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,920
respecting each other to have the right

2260
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,440
to have a different opinion

2261
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,040
and to just get on with the one thing

2262
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,320
we're supposed to be on the same page

2263
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:38,800
about

2264
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,360
which is non-human animal rights deserve

2265
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,080
to have

2266
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,080
this three or four hours dedicated to

2267
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,120
them on the streets

2268
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,760
yeah i guess i guess to kind of close

2269
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,320
this off

2270
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:53,600
or i hope we can close it off as if

2271
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,920
so if if uh we have i mean obviously

2272
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,120
there are there are obviously trans

2273
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,640
activists right i'm focusing on trans

2274
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,679
here because i understand what you're

2275
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,920
saying about gender pronouns in that

2276
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,239
if somebody has chosen a pronoun because

2277
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:05,120
it's

2278
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,159
whatever it's something they want to

2279
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,760
identify as i understand why there's

2280
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,159
some

2281
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,840
some skepticism here because it's kind

2282
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,840
of like all right that's fine

2283
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,000
you'll go ahead and do that and people

2284
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,199
can respect that but if

2285
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:18,640
if they forget or if they

2286
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,800
i don't know if they don't want to and

2287
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,719
there's no real logic behind the reason

2288
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:24,159
that the view identifying is that i can

2289
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,199
understand why someone

2290
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,040
you know not being into that but where

2291
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,880
i'm specifically focusing on here

2292
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,040
and and i'm focusing on it because it is

2293
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,719
it is medical it is it is it is a

2294
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,400
psychological thing it is not something

2295
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,040
that's like

2296
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,880
opinion is that you know gender

2297
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:38,880
dysphoria exists like trans people exist

2298
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,199
we have to

2299
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,320
time but now it's becoming more

2300
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,920
acceptable to discuss it right

2301
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,760
so you see a lot more people who are

2302
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,679
coming out this way whereas in the past

2303
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:50,719
they wouldn't have done they would have

2304
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,000
hidden it because they were embarrassed

2305
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,199
or ashamed and they just go through

2306
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,480
their whole life with this

2307
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,159
situation you know with this this

2308
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,080
problem nowadays uh people are

2309
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,600
being encouraged to speak up about it

2310
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,360
and you know go public and get the

2311
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,239
operation and

2312
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:03,760
and re-identify themselves so that

2313
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,239
they're more they are who they are right

2314
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:09,280
what i'm trying to get here is that does

2315
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,920
does av have like uh something in place

2316
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,920
that is also accommodating that

2317
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,920
so that so that if somebody does come to

2318
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,920
a cube as a trans person

2319
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,760
um and they want to be identified as a

2320
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,960
he um or

2321
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,320
she or they if they're not sure um

2322
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,280
and somebody is is you know if they get

2323
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,040
it wrong by accident okay i get that

2324
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,159
that's something that you know

2325
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:31,520
it shouldn't if it's a complaint you

2326
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,760
just say okay hey please you know don't

2327
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,199
don't get it wrong by accident in the

2328
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:36,880
future like do us a favor but if if

2329
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,040
they're choosing to get it wrong

2330
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,640
if they're like actually saying no i

2331
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,320
don't accept that

2332
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,800
are you saying that yeah bullying yeah

2333
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,560
that could that could be bullying yeah

2334
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,560
um but also i kind of i'm kind of trying

2335
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,080
to understand where the line's drawn

2336
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,920
between well that's your ideology so

2337
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:52,719
tough [ __ ]

2338
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:54,960
versus well okay no this is something

2339
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,800
that this is you this is who you are

2340
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,640
and look this person needs to respect

2341
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,320
that or or they're the one that'll

2342
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,679
be kicked out like where are you where

2343
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,360
are you drawing the line between the

2344
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,360
ideology versus the bullying if you

2345
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,800
understand what i'm saying

2346
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,719
because maybe an organizer says well i

2347
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,000
don't need to respect that because i

2348
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,040
don't agree

2349
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,840
where's the line drawn

2350
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,560
the line is simply drawn at if the

2351
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,719
interaction at the cube requires your

2352
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,480
gender

2353
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,960
then okay we'll use whatever gender you

2354
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,640
choose us to use

2355
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,800
however whatever name because in that

2356
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,040
case they can also use the name if the

2357
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,640
organizer or the volunteer

2358
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,120
feels uncomfortable or they don't align

2359
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,800
with the same ideologies

2360
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,159
they don't have to use the pronoun they

2361
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,159
can just refer to them with their chosen

2362
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:38,960
name

2363
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,640
yeah that's what i was going to say is

2364
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,960
that the interactions the cube don't

2365
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,320
actually require

2366
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,719
don't actually require the gender so

2367
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:48,480
that's what i was saying is that

2368
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,480
if i'm trying to be charitable and

2369
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,840
open-minded here by saying

2370
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,000
if there is a circumstance of the cube

2371
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,280
that requires the gender and the

2372
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,120
interaction to be successful

2373
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,640
in the communication sure no not using

2374
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,719
that would be rude it would be bullying

2375
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,560
and when there's no case at a cube of

2376
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,320
truth

2377
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,600
where this has happened we're with

2378
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,360
bullied people and said

2379
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,199
[ __ ] your beliefs that's never happened

2380
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,800
it's just ridiculous to even suggest

2381
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,480
that that has happened

2382
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,280
but you know but it's not required

2383
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,800
that's what we're saying

2384
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,840
it's not required it's it's yeah this

2385
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,080
this notion that it is required is a new

2386
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,239
notion that's being brought into a b

2387
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:29,440
it's never been required and um i

2388
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,760
i think i know something that was

2389
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,560
brought up

2390
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,920
a while ago was um people are suggesting

2391
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,120
that

2392
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,880
at the start of the cube because we do a

2393
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,679
briefing right when everyone's there

2394
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,440
getting ready to do the cube

2395
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,400
somebody or maybe a few people suggested

2396
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:48,880
that

2397
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:51,120
we do this like we go around and get

2398
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,159
people to

2399
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:55,600
introduce themselves and choose their

2400
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,520
preferred like announce their preferred

2401
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,960
pronoun and this

2402
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,960
is something that brought was brought up

2403
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,679
to us and that was our response because

2404
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,280
something like that 100 takes away from

2405
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,120
what we're doing because it's

2406
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,920
not necessary and it's irrelevant so to

2407
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,440
put time aside

2408
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,679
15 20 minutes for everyone to go around

2409
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:17,840
and say my name is blah blah blah and

2410
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,760
this is my preferred pronoun

2411
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,639
which is unnecessary because in case we

2412
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:23,760
need to refer to you

2413
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,000
you let us know then if we got it wrong

2414
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,080
you correct us that's fine we can get on

2415
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,120
with our day

2416
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,280
um i know that that was something that

2417
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:32,480
was brought up and i just wanted to

2418
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,280
clarify that

2419
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,000
there are many other things that are

2420
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,679
human-centric

2421
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,920
that we don't allocate

2422
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,400
our activism our time to at the cubes

2423
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,159
to engaging in and so you could use this

2424
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,000
same logic if you're claiming

2425
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,360
that we are discriminatory towards

2426
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,719
those who have uh

2427
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,480
again we've never even spoken about

2428
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,920
trans people so i reject

2429
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,159
the notion of even commenting on trans

2430
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,040
people

2431
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,320
people with gender pronouns uh the same

2432
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,800
argument could be used

2433
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,480
for uh not um honoring the custodians of

2434
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,560
the land and saying something about like

2435
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,239
the original custodians the land the

2436
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,679
aboriginals or

2437
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:21,840
or the native americans depending on the

2438
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,840
of the region that we're talking about

2439
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,320
here

2440
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,920
we don't do that at the cubes either

2441
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,520
does that mean that we are also

2442
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,840
racist or we're also colo colon

2443
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,239
colonialists

2444
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:34,239
or whatever the word is that's being

2445
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,520
tossed around regarding that

2446
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,639
discrimination

2447
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,600
no of course not because we're there for

2448
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,360
non-humans and non-humans deserve a

2449
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,040
cause dedicated to them that's what this

2450
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,080
comes down to

2451
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,920
is if you think that we're being

2452
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:47,920
discriminatory

2453
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,480
under that logic then you really just

2454
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,080
don't think that animals deserve a cause

2455
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,520
solely dedicated to them

2456
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,040
that's what we're disagreeing about yeah

2457
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,000
yeah i guess i guess my my what i'm what

2458
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,360
i was trying to get out of it here is

2459
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,920
try to get to clarify what for 100 this

2460
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,520
which i think you have clarified now

2461
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,239
is that like the the you know what you

2462
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,440
don't want people you don't want to

2463
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,320
bring up

2464
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:13,360
um like let's say

2465
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,760
identity politics into into cubing you

2466
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,199
don't want it to become part of

2467
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,199
av you don't want it to become part of

2468
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,120
an action or an event

2469
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:24,719
um however if somebody has personal

2470
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,880
a personal thing where they want to be

2471
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,159
referred to as

2472
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,159
a certain pronoun or they've recently

2473
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,199
transitioned

2474
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,520
that av is part of av policies to

2475
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,360
respect that because not respecting that

2476
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,040
would be considered bullying

2477
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,320
that's what i'm trying to clarify here

2478
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,679
so this is you're making a distinction

2479
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:40,880
between the two

2480
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,880
i also need to make the distinction here

2481
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:43,920
that

2482
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:46,800
we're referring to sex if anything

2483
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,040
whenever the word gender is being used

2484
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,480
in this conversation

2485
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,400
we are not referring to anything other

2486
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,920
than sex

2487
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,760
we are not referring our repeat to

2488
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,000
anything other than sex

2489
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,920
and the conversation keeps getting

2490
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,760
skewed by others

2491
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,360
to be referring to gender but uh

2492
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,760
regarding trans issues or regarding this

2493
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:08,800
whole thing

2494
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,719
uh with my comments on being skeptical

2495
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:13,920
of gender pronouns

2496
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:15,840
it was regarding sex that i was

2497
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,440
skeptical of this

2498
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,120
there aren't more than two sexes in my

2499
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,120
opinion and i think that people are

2500
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,880
entitled to have that opinion

2501
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,560
trans people are transitioning between

2502
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,239
those two sexes i think they have the

2503
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:27,360
right to do that

2504
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,679
so i support the trans movement if

2505
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:30,880
that's what it is right

2506
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:33,199
i have trans people that follow me that

2507
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:34,960
support me that like me

2508
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,440
in the face of my comments and the hate

2509
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,800
i receive

2510
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,120
getting called a transfer does not waver

2511
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,000
these people

2512
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,600
i'm not trying to use them as a token

2513
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,120
i'm just giving people context

2514
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,760
because context is lost in our in our

2515
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,120
culture

2516
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,719
and yeah that's all i have to say

2517
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,000
okay um

2518
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:59,520
yeah yes i'm trying to wrap my head

2519
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,880
around it and also i just sorry i was

2520
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,080
just taking care of a troll

2521
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,760
as well i'm just asking annie to get rid

2522
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,199
of a troll in the chat as i was also

2523
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:06,400
trying to get that sword it

2524
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,040
seems like they're bothering people so

2525
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:09,440
you

2526
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,679
obviously you make a separation between

2527
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:12,560
um

2528
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,440
sex and gender which i think most well i

2529
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,000
mean that's just

2530
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,920
that's that's scientific um there is

2531
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,520
there is actually i think

2532
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,520
um some people would argue including

2533
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,120
myself that there are three sexes

2534
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,239
because there's intersex

2535
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,159
which is very rare but it exists right

2536
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,159
it's it's when someone's born with

2537
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,280
both or like like you know both um

2538
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:32,880
genetics or whatever i don't know too

2539
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,639
much about it but i know that it exists

2540
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:35,360
um

2541
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,960
and then yeah and then and then you're

2542
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,360
drawing the line because because um

2543
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,080
yeah because genders it's a new it is an

2544
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,480
ideology the ideology gender ideology is

2545
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,360
new it is new

2546
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:47,199
if anyone's upset about this then i'm

2547
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,639
not sorry because you need to do some

2548
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,000
research on this and how

2549
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,760
realize how gender ideology is a very

2550
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,840
recent thing and it hasn't been put

2551
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,719
through

2552
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:57,679
uh the rigorous testing that most other

2553
01:24:57,679 --> 01:24:58,560
psychological

2554
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,360
and scientific you know concepts have

2555
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,880
you know about humans have been through

2556
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:03,280
so

2557
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,480
it's not something that should be

2558
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,560
accepted um

2559
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,880
just because it's big and because it's

2560
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,840
being pushed

2561
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,480
but at the same time for good or for bad

2562
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,880
there are people out there who

2563
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,679
uh yeah like specifically it is it is

2564
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:18,159
very much

2565
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,080
intertwined with trends with the trans

2566
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,600
issues which is why it keeps coming up

2567
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,040
and this you didn't you said earlier i

2568
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,239
don't understand why people keep saying

2569
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:25,199
it's about trans

2570
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,120
it's because i feel i feel personally i

2571
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,639
don't tell me if i'm wrong i feel like

2572
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:29,360
that

2573
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,480
that um i wouldn't say popularity but

2574
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,040
the

2575
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,120
the more exposure let's say the more

2576
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,040
awareness of trends and what it means to

2577
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:37,840
be trans

2578
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,639
has also come tied in with gender and

2579
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:41,840
and gender identity

2580
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,120
yeah because right yeah confuse the

2581
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,040
issue though i think deliberately they

2582
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:47,520
have to

2583
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:50,560
use the two now it's like all mixed in

2584
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,120
but it doesn't need to be because when

2585
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,880
we're talking about gender pronouns and

2586
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,440
gender

2587
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,400
we're talking about gender roles and

2588
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,199
like

2589
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,760
you can you can be a female like you can

2590
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,080
be born a female in a female body but

2591
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,760
you may not necessarily

2592
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,600
feel like you are fitting into that

2593
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,120
you know that i don't know mindset or

2594
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:14,000
that

2595
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
gender role and that's totally fine but

2596
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,520
that's not what we're talking about when

2597
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,960
we're talking about like someone

2598
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,800
transitioning you're talking about them

2599
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,159
changing their their

2600
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,320
body and that's the sex it's like when

2601
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,400
you go to the doctor they they care

2602
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,880
about knowing your birth sex because

2603
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:30,800
you know the doctor needs about your

2604
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,120
body and your biology so that's why

2605
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,719
sex and gender are different and if

2606
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:37,360
anyone wants to confuse the two

2607
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,280
that's just not gonna you know that's

2608
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,199
fine but that's that's just not the

2609
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,400
reality of it

2610
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,760
they're completely separate uh

2611
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:50,320
and my trans um supporters tell me this

2612
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:55,360
and and i agree with them convoluting

2613
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,440
conflating gender politics

2614
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,719
uh the gender pronoun

2615
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,800
issue in society that's been brought up

2616
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,360
uh with the trans movement and struggle

2617
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,639
of trans people

2618
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,080
is actually diminishing them as victims

2619
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,560
of their struggle so it takes away from

2620
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,080
what they're really dealing with and

2621
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,840
uh they're not struggling with gender

2622
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,440
pronouns necessarily like the

2623
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,080
the the struggles are different they're

2624
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,840
they're struggling

2625
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,239
with uh with just being accepted as a

2626
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:29,679
trans person and that's a different

2627
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:30,639
discussion

2628
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,560
completely to what we're discussing here

2629
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,080
this is what they tell me

2630
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,000
and i agree with them and uh

2631
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,440
it's disrespectful to the trans movement

2632
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,000
to just attach all these other things to

2633
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,719
it and say that's a trans issue too

2634
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,719
yeah if you care about the trans

2635
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:49,760
movement

2636
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,000
then you wouldn't do that i understand

2637
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,040
so yeah

2638
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,880
there's a distinction between just

2639
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,560
wanting to identify

2640
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,920
as one of the limitless genders and

2641
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:00,639
actually

2642
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,199
suffering from gender dysphoria and and

2643
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:04,960
changing your sex and wanting to be

2644
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,400
referred to as a different pronoun

2645
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,120
because

2646
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,679
it it validates who you are and it's

2647
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:10,560
something that you have

2648
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,320
struggled through yes you're drawing

2649
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,920
there's a distinction between the two

2650
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:14,800
basically

2651
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,719
is what you're saying right there

2652
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,159
absolutely is and

2653
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,760
trans people around the world feel

2654
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,080
diminished because of this

2655
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:25,360
this incessant um obsessive

2656
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,480
need to link it to everything else and

2657
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,280
have already

2658
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,560
finished on top okay but

2659
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,840
it's but although although you hold this

2660
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,960
belief and obviously av

2661
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,840
operates on this um not belief i

2662
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,520
wouldn't say but let's say opinion

2663
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,520
and the av operates also on this opinion

2664
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,679
like that av will not accept

2665
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,719
um people bringing in ideologies

2666
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,320
um without let's say like obviously

2667
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,000
trans trend the trans movement isn't an

2668
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,040
ideology um

2669
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,400
not for the not for the people who are

2670
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,480
actually uh you know suffering from

2671
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,159
gender dysphoria anyway although there

2672
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,679
are people who are calling themselves

2673
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,199
trans who are actually not

2674
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,560
don't have gender dysphoria then that's

2675
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:06,159
an ideology i would say that's different

2676
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,360
that's a political

2677
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,679
um ideology or or some i don't know

2678
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,280
ideology of some sort

2679
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,320
um but unfortunately i would say it is

2680
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:16,719
it is difficult to actually determine

2681
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:17,520
who is who

2682
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:19,840
right and and who is for real and who is

2683
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:21,440
doing this because they genuinely

2684
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,600
you know are a trans person and who is

2685
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:25,280
doing this because they have

2686
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,560
they want to get on board with an

2687
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,719
ideology and and kind of i don't know

2688
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,760
be different um i guess

2689
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,159
how does av how does it how is av going

2690
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:35,840
to operate with that because

2691
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,840
i know that you like you've just said

2692
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,679
you'll you accept people who have

2693
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,040
uh and you accept and will respect

2694
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,800
people who are genuinely

2695
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,040
you know are trans or or whatever if

2696
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,719
they have whatever condition the av

2697
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:48,239
will respect them and people will be

2698
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,760
booted if they don't respect them

2699
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,600
but then also in the same breath you're

2700
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,840
saying that the political ideology is

2701
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,199
not actually welcome

2702
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,120
and so if somebody isn't actually trans

2703
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,639
and they are just identifying as someone

2704
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,159
else because it's something they want to

2705
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:00,960
do

2706
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,760
so how is av going to actually how would

2707
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:04,639
you operate with

2708
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:06,320
these two individuals let's say being

2709
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,760
around how are you going to determine

2710
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,239
who

2711
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:10,239
who should be respected and and you know

2712
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,440
should be dealt with in a

2713
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,760
very in a respectful way and who should

2714
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,199
actually be told no

2715
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:16,719
don't bring your ideologies here leave

2716
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,320
it at home

2717
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,520
well everyone everyone everyone needs to

2718
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,040
be respected

2719
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:26,719
okay everyone including

2720
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,639
yeah that's the answer everyone needs to

2721
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:29,840
be respected so

2722
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,000
i mean uh

2723
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,560
everyone is entitled to their opinions

2724
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,080
but no one is entitled

2725
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:42,400
to use their to weaponize their opinions

2726
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,440
against others and that's my

2727
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,800
most accurate answer to that okay sure

2728
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,360
everyone is respected for their opinions

2729
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,520
and their right to have an opinion

2730
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,600
no one has a right to weaponize their

2731
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,920
opinion against others in any way

2732
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,320
and so

2733
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,120
that's it i mean you know where do we

2734
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,800
draw the line with human stuff as well

2735
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,360
because

2736
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,199
we allow people who are disabled to come

2737
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:08,639
to our cubes and

2738
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,800
rock a wheelchair in the cube we've had

2739
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,320
so many people in

2740
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,040
wheelchairs in our cubes around the

2741
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,320
world

2742
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,880
we don't say

2743
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,080
we don't you know we welcome these

2744
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,760
people i don't know why i'm using that

2745
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:26,080
as a point i guess it's just of course

2746
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,440
we welcome different

2747
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,760
uh struggles and we accommodate

2748
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,600
different struggles within nav

2749
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,000
but only as far as getting the job done

2750
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:34,880
is required

2751
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,320
because we're there for the animals and

2752
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:40,320
that just needs to be respected also

2753
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,719
everyone needs to be respected

2754
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:44,719
for the mission when we're at the cube

2755
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,159
but i think we should move on now to the

2756
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,040
next

2757
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,840
subject all right all right okay can i

2758
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,440
close off of the bottom line and bottom

2759
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,960
line yes or no question and then we'll

2760
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,600
move on is that all right with you

2761
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,920
but it's bottom line yes or no then so

2762
01:31:57,920 --> 01:31:59,600
what i'm understanding is

2763
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,920
that someone comes to the cube they

2764
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,600
request to be called

2765
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,719
a certain thing and people in the cubes

2766
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:08,320
people the organizers

2767
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,600
are requested to respect that and

2768
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,120
if they get it wrong by accident no

2769
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,880
worries don't do it again if you get it

2770
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,920
wrong on purpose you're being

2771
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,520
disrespectful and you'll be

2772
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,840
you'll be if it comes up you will be

2773
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,320
told either told off or or i don't know

2774
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,480
warned and saying that that's bullying

2775
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,480
am i right is that correct is that if i

2776
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,000
understood this correctly or is there

2777
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,639
something i've missed

2778
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:38,320
um sorry i

2779
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,560
sorry i just kind of zoned out for a bit

2780
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:41,440
so you said

2781
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,320
right somebody got it wrong by accident

2782
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,440
no worries

2783
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,719
obviously what are we gonna do um

2784
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,800
and then if they did it on purpose

2785
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,080
they're gonna get kicked out

2786
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,159
is that always not kicked out whatever

2787
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:55,920
it may be they'd be either warned

2788
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,840
or if it's been multiple times let's say

2789
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:59,440
you would you would take a further

2790
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,560
action if it's if it's

2791
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,320
becoming a habit you know if it's

2792
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,679
something they've done more than once

2793
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,120
for example

2794
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,239
yeah um yeah basically but like what i

2795
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:10,400
was saying earlier if somebody feels

2796
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,639
that strongly about it that they're not

2797
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,880
willing to because they feel like

2798
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,040
they're accepting that ideology

2799
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:20,400
by referring to um say you showed up at

2800
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,920
a cube and you want to be referred to as

2801
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,320
she

2802
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,280
and like i just can't accept that then

2803
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:26,560
in that case

2804
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,679
they could refer to you with

2805
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,400
your name and if they're not willing to

2806
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,040
do that

2807
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,040
then yes that would be an issue because

2808
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,159
then that person

2809
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,000
buying this thing on not wanting to

2810
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,920
refer to you as whatever

2811
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,000
then that that person is taking away

2812
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,440
from the event in the queue

2813
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,280
because they're good yeah they're making

2814
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:47,040
good about anything else

2815
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:48,560
yeah they're making yeah okay but i

2816
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,080
think that yeah that

2817
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,400
seems reasonable to me but i'm i'm i

2818
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,560
guess it's not good enough for everyone

2819
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,080
for a lot of people but i i feel like

2820
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,520
it's reasonable i just wanted to clarify

2821
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,880
it before we moved on though

2822
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,760
yeah when we move on i just want to say

2823
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,280
one more time like this has

2824
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,920
literally never happened in our personal

2825
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:06,719
experience has

2826
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:09,760
never happened and i haven't heard of a

2827
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,960
specific

2828
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:14,560
um event where this was the issue and

2829
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:14,960
this

2830
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:17,840
this was brought up and somebody you

2831
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,520
know had an issue with

2832
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,679
referring to someone else with their

2833
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,120
preferred name or pronouns

2834
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,719
i just want to say how uncommon this is

2835
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,199
but yeah i guess it's just about future

2836
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:30,880
proofing because this is the world we're

2837
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:31,199
in

2838
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:34,000
um now you know uh it's it's i don't

2839
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,600
think it's a bad world that we're in i

2840
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:37,520
think it's good i think uh

2841
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:38,960
that's why i wanted to really get into

2842
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:40,719
it because i i am 100

2843
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,639
certain that as as we go into the future

2844
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:44,000
this is going to become more and more

2845
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,440
and more common and not just in

2846
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:48,239
av in other organizations like you know

2847
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:48,960
jobs like

2848
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:50,480
people working in offices and stuff like

2849
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:51,760
that this is going to start becoming

2850
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,679
more and more common because

2851
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:55,520
people you know in general people don't

2852
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,880
like change um

2853
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,360
in general uh so you're gonna have to i

2854
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,719
think we i feel we hope we all have to

2855
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:02,080
expect that we're gonna be some people

2856
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,600
out there who are gonna cause problems

2857
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:04,800
on both sides of this

2858
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,639
you know not only on the people

2859
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,719
rejecting the idea side but also

2860
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:10,880
the people demanding they be referred to

2861
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,760
as a certain thing

2862
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,600
it's gonna or it's only going to become

2863
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,199
more prevalent i guess that's why i feel

2864
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:16,719
like it's an important topic

2865
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:19,280
to get into well again like you know

2866
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,159
yeah

2867
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:21,679
cap this off with a black and white

2868
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,199
answer and then sure

2869
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:26,639
you know it's it works the other way as

2870
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:27,040
well

2871
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:29,520
like no bullying will be allowed but

2872
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,040
also if you're bullying others to

2873
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,239
believe what you believe

2874
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,800
at the cube that's not a lot either if

2875
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,719
you're not required to hand it to to

2876
01:35:36,719 --> 01:35:37,760
give us your gender

2877
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,920
in that interaction and you're forcing

2878
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:40,800
it anyway

2879
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,960
that's an issue yeah that's a problem

2880
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,159
because that's not

2881
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:46,800
that's not productive communication and

2882
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:47,360
uh

2883
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,440
and teamwork when the goal is supposed

2884
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,119
to be non-human animal rights

2885
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:54,560
yeah it goes both ways yeah

2886
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,800
sure just but basically just just

2887
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,080
respect each other

2888
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:01,520
it's the bottom line earlier the answer

2889
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,040
to it is everyone

2890
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,840
will be respected that's the rule all

2891
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,880
right

2892
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,159
got it all right cool

2893
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:12,560
cool let's uh we're going from one to

2894
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,440
another i guess

2895
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,360
uh in terms of this i think these might

2896
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,639
be a little bit easier to get into

2897
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,239
though because there's just some

2898
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,159
there's a few more like more direct

2899
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:21,520
accusations that came through

2900
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,600
however they didn't really come through

2901
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,960
with any kind of

2902
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,560
backing but i wanted to put them to you

2903
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,000
as like a topic of like

2904
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,360
why do you think people are saying this

2905
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,280
right and you can tell me why you think

2906
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,239
people are saying this

2907
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:34,480
so there's been accusations of of of

2908
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,239
racism as well against av as an

2909
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:37,679
organization and also

2910
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:39,600
i'm sorry paul but it tends to be coming

2911
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,360
at you most of the time um with these

2912
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,920
things the sal seems to get off the hook

2913
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,880
um but um this racism apparently av is

2914
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,880
racist and apparently paul is racist

2915
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,800
and i think some of this did come from

2916
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,480
the the blm post

2917
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,960
um but that was an av thing that wasn't

2918
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,239
necessarily a poll thing

2919
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:57,760
why why do you think people are coming

2920
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,679
at you and and making accusations that

2921
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:00,239
you are

2922
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:03,600
a racist individually paul or not av

2923
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,040
we'll deal with av in a second but why

2924
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,560
do you think it's coming for you

2925
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,440
that people say this

2926
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:17,520
who isn't called a racist in 2020

2927
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:20,080
i'm suss on anyone not being called a

2928
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,800
racist in 2020

2929
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,080
uh why is i mean i'm

2930
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,199
answering quantum physics in that

2931
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:30,800
question i don't know the answer it's

2932
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,639
like

2933
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,920
uh yeah i don't know why why humans

2934
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,360
the way they are i i just i really

2935
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,960
i don't know it's uh i i actually

2936
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,400
haven't ever heard anyone

2937
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,320
directly call me a racist because of the

2938
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,480
blm pope like me personally yeah

2939
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,639
no no that's let's say an av thing i

2940
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:51,600
think it's

2941
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,320
a general thing

2942
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,760
yeah i mean we have been called a racist

2943
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,760
both of us not over that post though

2944
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,920
but yeah i don't know why

2945
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,000
i'm not sure why actually i'd like to

2946
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,199
see evidence

2947
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:12,480
your honor the evidence please

2948
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,320
yeah i think there was there was there

2949
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,080
was a post i'm just remembering now

2950
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,080
i think that it could have i don't know

2951
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,600
contributed to it i think where you were

2952
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,880
you were talking to a

2953
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,199
you were outreaching a black guy and you

2954
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:24,639
said some things about you know you

2955
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:25,840
defended the animals

2956
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,840
um and i think some people found it to

2957
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,600
be somehow racist

2958
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,600
because of the words you used and do you

2959
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,800
remember that at all

2960
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,679
like yes black guy was a black girl so

2961
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:36,960
you misgendered her

2962
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,480
you should really be ashamed of yourself

2963
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:42,400
let's cancel david immediately

2964
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:44,800
trust me trust me out of this video this

2965
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,239
is not going to be the thing that gets

2966
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:47,360
taken there's there's

2967
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,280
things we've said already that i've as

2968
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,560
they came out of my mouth

2969
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,760
i was like yeah that's going to be

2970
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,040
that's going to be screenshotted that's

2971
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,560
going to be all over the place soon

2972
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,880
so no don't worry we're already that

2973
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,159
boat was sailed we're done

2974
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:03,520
um so if you watch the video guys she

2975
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,760
was making a point

2976
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,320
to me that she doesn't need to take

2977
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,400
animal rights seriously especially even

2978
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:10,960
if she

2979
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:14,560
is the oppressor in this scenario

2980
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,159
as a non-vegan because black people

2981
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,719
are oppressed that was her argument that

2982
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:22,159
she put to me

2983
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:23,920
and she even said something to the

2984
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:26,000
effect that speciesism doesn't apply

2985
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,480
to me and my people and i said it

2986
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,719
applies to anybody who oppresses animals

2987
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:34,320
who isn't vegan uh she carried on

2988
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,119
and i felt it was only right to make the

2989
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:38,320
point

2990
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,400
that animals are the most oppressed

2991
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:43,679
group of beings on the planet

2992
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,639
it felt to me the most appropriate thing

2993
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:47,600
to say at that

2994
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,320
time because i speak on behalf of the

2995
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:50,960
animals

2996
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,159
if i was in their position that's

2997
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:54,080
exactly what i would want to be

2998
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,239
said in that moment so that that person

2999
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:59,440
had the correct perspective

3000
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,320
uh whether they accept the truth is not

3001
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,520
my

3002
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:08,560
uh i don't i don't have any uh

3003
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,080
skin in that game my

3004
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,159
mission is to tell the truth on behalf

3005
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:15,679
of the victims because it's the least

3006
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:16,320
that we can do

3007
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,360
so that's what i said and that was that

3008
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:19,760
was

3009
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,840
uh what people have called me racist

3010
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,040
over

3011
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,080
so that was like i mean it's let's let's

3012
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,520
let's be like that's not [ __ ] here

3013
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,960
it's definitely something that would be

3014
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:31,199
considered to be like insensitive

3015
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,920
but but that's not your the goal isn't

3016
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,880
to be sensitive

3017
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,199
um a lot you know it's i don't think

3018
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:38,639
being insensitive is necessarily

3019
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,159
something negative i think sometimes it

3020
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:41,119
needs to be

3021
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:43,119
um like that but but how is that

3022
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:45,119
translating to racism like if somebody

3023
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:45,920
said paul

3024
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,159
you're [ __ ] insensitive i i wouldn't

3025
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:49,440
i don't think i'd even bring that up

3026
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,080
because it's like

3027
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,560
well yeah that's obvious like you you

3028
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:55,360
know your outreach videos tend to be

3029
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,360
towards the side of insensitivity and

3030
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,719
more towards the side of like

3031
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,480
straight direct like you're gonna get

3032
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:01,840
the message whether it pisses you off or

3033
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,520
not right if you're being sensitive

3034
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,360
you would dress it up and be nice but

3035
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:06,560
you're not being and that's not

3036
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,400
something to criticize in my opinion or

3037
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:09,199
it is whatever

3038
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:10,480
but that's not the point here the point

3039
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,800
is racism so how does that translate to

3040
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,600
racism

3041
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,960
how do you think someone gets it from

3042
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,840
that video that that's you

3043
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:19,280
somehow you know disrespecting somebody

3044
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:19,840
because of

3045
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,800
their ethnicity just because of her skin

3046
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,679
color right

3047
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:26,239
well no no again no it's not just well

3048
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:27,840
it's not just that you are speaking

3049
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,440
to a white woman would would you get

3050
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,600
no of course not but it's not just that

3051
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:34,560
it's also

3052
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,560
the fact what people are overlooking

3053
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,920
here

3054
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,080
is if if we are going to entertain the

3055
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,920
notion that there is insensitivity at

3056
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,199
play here

3057
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:44,880
people are overlooking the fact that she

3058
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,199
was being incredibly insensitive to the

3059
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:48,800
animal victims that she

3060
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:51,360
is an oppressor of directly responsible

3061
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,760
for victimizing herself

3062
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,719
and so that's where it started that's

3063
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:58,960
where the context of all of this began

3064
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,679
i was responding to her not by saying

3065
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:02,719
[ __ ] black

3066
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:04,960
people and [ __ ] black rights but by

3067
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:05,760
saying

3068
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,440
animals are the most oppressed group of

3069
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,960
beings on the planet

3070
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,480
if me pointing out a fact is insensitive

3071
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:15,119
while she's literally saying [ __ ] the

3072
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:16,320
animals

3073
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,600
and [ __ ] their rights well

3074
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,639
i guess you need to ask yourself

3075
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,440
which like what does it take for you to

3076
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,280
see injustice for what it is

3077
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,880
especially when it's to the degree that

3078
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,840
it is he in this case with the animals

3079
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,760
when they're subjected to the most

3080
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:34,960
brutal

3081
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,800
violence that has ever been carried out

3082
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,719
on any group of beings ever

3083
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,480
what does it take for people to to just

3084
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,800
literally just acknowledge them and to

3085
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,080
acknowledge

3086
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:49,119
the fact that they are subjected

3087
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,199
to oppression to the extent that they

3088
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,159
are subjected

3089
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:54,400
to that oppression and for simply just

3090
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,159
simply for people to simply

3091
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,560
say that for people to simply speak

3092
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,000
about that

3093
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,320
if that's offensive we have no hope as a

3094
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,840
species evolving

3095
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,440
and developing into better ways of

3096
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:11,040
of living on this planet and uh

3097
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:13,280
with truly addressing injustice and

3098
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,800
oppression on this planet it's never

3099
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,520
going to happen

3100
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:18,000
unless we change the way we think around

3101
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,560
things like this

3102
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:23,760
yeah i i i think honestly

3103
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,320
my opinion on this is like to label that

3104
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,239
as racism

3105
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:31,840
is is offensive um to

3106
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,520
it's offensive because it's not even

3107
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,600
offensive it's it's harmful

3108
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:38,239
because it confuses what actual racism

3109
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:39,199
is

3110
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:41,920
right how how can you call like this is

3111
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,400
this

3112
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,840
when you really lay it out like this

3113
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,239
right you've got two people of color

3114
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,080
you're not white so two people of color

3115
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,560
having a conversation about the animals

3116
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:53,360
and one of the people says that you know

3117
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,199
the reality about the animals

3118
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:58,080
and somehow that person is racist it's

3119
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,600
just such a strange thing to

3120
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,880
call racism over and it completely

3121
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,480
takes away the meaning of the word and

3122
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,000
i've said this before people get really

3123
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,320
upset about it that the more you use the

3124
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,199
word racist

3125
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:11,440
sexist transphobe the more difficult it

3126
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,360
becomes to actually identify

3127
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:16,719
racists sexists and transphobes and and

3128
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:17,199
i think

3129
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:19,119
nowadays we're in a position where it's

3130
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:20,400
like you said who hasn't been called a

3131
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,119
racist

3132
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:24,480
um or a transphobe or a sexist in 2020

3133
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:27,199
practically anyone who has dared to even

3134
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,639
question the narrative

3135
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:30,159
has been called one of those things it's

3136
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:32,320
either you you do what you're told

3137
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,320
and you say what you're supposed to say

3138
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,000
or that's what you get branded with

3139
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,239
do you know how harmful that is to the

3140
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,400
people who actually suffer from sexism

3141
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,480
racism and transphobia

3142
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,520
the fact that you know that label is so

3143
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,080
used so flippantly if you could you

3144
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,199
could say that for every

3145
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,679
every other label that is thrown around

3146
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:52,639
um

3147
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:57,199
to to to to try and cancel others

3148
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:00,000
when uh when baseless whether it's the

3149
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:00,560
term

3150
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:02,760
fascist or or

3151
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:03,920
[Music]

3152
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,400
sexist or racist or or whatever it is

3153
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:11,360
it takes these people are supposed to

3154
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:13,199
care about these injustices when they're

3155
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,119
literally spitting in the faces of the

3156
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,320
victims

3157
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:19,920
that are subjected by those injustices

3158
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,440
when they do that definitely

3159
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,880
and move it on to the av racism

3160
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:29,920
claim the blm post that was the uh the

3161
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,760
center of apparent

3162
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,239
uh racism you know this is the uh

3163
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:35,199
apparently that

3164
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:37,920
post was in itself racist and and those

3165
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,360
it's gone now obviously but for those

3166
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,400
who didn't see it

3167
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,320
it was the image the famous image that

3168
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,800
went around of a blm activist

3169
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,440
a black man holding a pig's head by the

3170
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,600
ears a severed pig's head by the ears

3171
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:52,239
to protest against police brutality a

3172
01:45:52,239 --> 01:45:53,119
navy

3173
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:56,400
av put out a an image with the caption

3174
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,280
and that was it ended up causing so much

3175
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:01,280
controversy and claims of racism and all

3176
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:02,239
these things and it

3177
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:04,320
and it was removed in the end right so

3178
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,000
like tell us the

3179
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,280
i know you've done it before again i'm

3180
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,159
sorry you have to keep repeating

3181
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:09,679
yourself but you know we are we're

3182
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:11,199
aiming to get through everything today

3183
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,119
but tell us the story behind that then

3184
01:46:13,119 --> 01:46:14,880
and and you know

3185
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,880
if you think that was racist as well and

3186
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,719
the reasons you removed it

3187
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,159
so it wasn't removed um

3188
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:25,520
it wasn't removed you know

3189
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:28,880
as a result of like

3190
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,560
so just to clarify it's still up on our

3191
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,320
instagram

3192
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,560
it's only been removed on facebook

3193
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,000
because

3194
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,360
we stupidly took i want to say

3195
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:43,520
take the bet we took the bait i don't

3196
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,880
know if that's the proper term to use

3197
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:46,320
here but whatever

3198
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,800
with regards to what the donor was

3199
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:49,840
demanding of us

3200
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,400
at the time throughout the whole debacle

3201
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,040
that we went through with the donor and

3202
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:59,920
uh so we made a decision

3203
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,520
to remove that post only because

3204
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,560
this donor was learning to

3205
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:09,840
remove our funding um

3206
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,280
and it was it was the only thing

3207
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,560
that we were willing to consider doing

3208
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,080
uh out of all the demands that they gave

3209
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:22,239
us we completely rejected the notion of

3210
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:24,320
a board of directors and the other

3211
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:27,040
things we we really push back on and we

3212
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,920
we try to be as as charitable and open

3213
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:31,199
to these demands as

3214
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:34,480
possible which is why we deleted that

3215
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,119
post

3216
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:38,400
as a decision we made and

3217
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,040
at this point we had deleted it probably

3218
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:43,280
a month and a half or two months

3219
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:46,719
after the post was made so at that point

3220
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:49,920
it had it had seen most of its traction

3221
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:51,760
you know so

3222
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:54,080
uh i just want to clarify it wasn't

3223
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:55,280
removed

3224
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:57,520
after getting heat from people in the

3225
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:59,679
comments section or anything like that

3226
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:02,840
it was uh it was a post that

3227
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:05,760
we believe needs to happen

3228
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,159
it's just the way that we communicated

3229
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:10,159
in that post that we felt we could

3230
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:10,719
improve

3231
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,440
on and we have already addressed this

3232
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,880
within the organization because recently

3233
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,239
we saw the same thing happening at

3234
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:17,679
another protest

3235
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:20,320
in spain and we made a post about that

3236
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,639
uh

3237
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,159
it didn't you know it didn't get as much

3238
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:27,119
traction

3239
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:30,080
but um you know so there's something to

3240
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,760
be said about being direct about these

3241
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:32,000
things

3242
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,840
when it's unpopular we share a lot of

3243
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,760
unpopular opinions that's what we do

3244
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,920
because the truth is unpopular at the

3245
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,840
best of times

3246
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:44,000
uh and yeah and uh

3247
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,320
we are committed to speak up against

3248
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,480
animal oppression wherever we see it so

3249
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,880
if it's been if it's being paraded on

3250
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,480
the on the main stage

3251
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:55,040
on in the mainstream on the news every

3252
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:55,840
around the world

3253
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,960
as a appropriate and acceptable way

3254
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:02,400
of addressing human um centric

3255
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:05,679
injustices you know to hold decapitated

3256
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:06,560
heads up

3257
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,760
to to say [ __ ] the police uh then we

3258
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,280
have a responsibility to say something

3259
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,480
about that

3260
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:15,840
um no oppression is acceptable ever

3261
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,520
no one has the right to oppress anyone

3262
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,119
else ever in any situation

3263
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:22,880
ever and uh and that's supposed to be

3264
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,119
the ethos behind these protests that

3265
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:26,719
were occurring this year and that's our

3266
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:27,679
ethos so

3267
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:30,400
we should be seeing eye to eye but uh

3268
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,400
yeah that's really our responsibility to

3269
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,119
do that

3270
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:35,360
but yeah we removed that post um as a

3271
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,040
result of the donor and we

3272
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:38,880
we regret that decision i don't know how

3273
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,639
else to say it but it's i mean we

3274
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:42,320
we still have it on instagram it's not

3275
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,719
being removed from instagram so

3276
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:47,440
from that what you will sure sure so

3277
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:47,840
it's

3278
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:50,880
that's yeah it clarifies a lot and and

3279
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,360
just to clarify here like you don't you

3280
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:57,360
don't believe that post was racist right

3281
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,159
no like what we said it it could have

3282
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:00,560
been

3283
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,320
communicated better um and that's why

3284
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,239
before we removed it we actually went in

3285
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:08,159
and edited the post a little bit so we

3286
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:10,800
changed the wording in certain parts

3287
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:14,239
um so that there was more

3288
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:16,800
empathy or you know it didn't come

3289
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,320
across as insensitive

3290
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,840
like you said but absolutely no

3291
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,239
it wasn't yes so i think i think that's

3292
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:25,119
that's a

3293
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,719
a wider issue really isn't it

3294
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:28,480
insensitivity versus

3295
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:31,599
uh versus racism or or whatever ism you

3296
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:33,360
want to attach it's uh

3297
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:36,080
it's not bigoted to be insensitive um

3298
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:36,639
it's

3299
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:39,040
some people are i don't know harsher

3300
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,000
than others

3301
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,800
and i think um on a personal level i

3302
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,480
think i think that's

3303
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,920
where a lot of the criticisms and

3304
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,599
accusations come from with av

3305
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:50,800
i don't think it's uh i think it is that

3306
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,880
our movement is quite a sensitive

3307
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:55,360
movement with very sensitive people and

3308
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:59,119
av isn't isn't very sensitive and that's

3309
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:00,080
that's not i don't mean that as a

3310
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,239
criticism at all i mean that as in

3311
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:03,920
some people don't like that and that's

3312
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,440
that's you know that's where we get a

3313
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,400
lot of

3314
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,920
a lot of people who come up and speak up

3315
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:09,599
about it whereas if you look at an

3316
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:11,360
organization like save for example

3317
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,880
they're the complete opposite side

3318
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,560
they're extremely sensitive

3319
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:16,400
and so they attract a lot of people who

3320
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,880
are uh you know also extremely sensitive

3321
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,000
which happens to be

3322
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,159
the vast majority of of the animal

3323
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,760
rights movement and

3324
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,840
the vegan movement people tend to be

3325
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,280
very sensitive

3326
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,520
in these groups so you know i can see i

3327
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:30,800
can see where the accusations come

3328
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,360
flying in from but um

3329
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,719
i think if they were accusing you of

3330
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:37,440
insensitivity and and being too mean

3331
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,840
i think that would probably be not as

3332
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:41,440
nowhere near as harmful as

3333
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,400
throwing the word racist at every turn

3334
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,679
you know

3335
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:47,520
that's my observation anyway that's what

3336
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,560
i'm observing from the outside

3337
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:51,920
and this kind of track this this

3338
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,760
continues really with the social media

3339
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:54,320
people

3340
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,159
have been upset by your social media

3341
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:57,440
quite a lot and i know some of these

3342
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,719
examples are going to be very easy to

3343
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,080
discuss but we'll start off with the

3344
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,440
most difficult one

3345
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:04,480
just to uh kick it off with this um

3346
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:07,280
i want to discuss the whole uh the whole

3347
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:08,400
hitler thing

3348
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,480
and george because a few people asked me

3349
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:11,920
about this they asked me about george

3350
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,599
they asked me about this post this

3351
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:15,199
this uh which obviously i know you

3352
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:16,639
removed it um

3353
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:19,040
but they kind of want to know how it got

3354
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,159
to the point where

3355
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:22,400
someone in the organization would think

3356
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,599
about making a post

3357
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,040
a comment like that and kind of what you

3358
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,119
guys think about it so

3359
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:28,800
if again for those who don't know there

3360
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,239
was the um

3361
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:31,760
there was a post made i believe it was

3362
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,760
it was avs page as well wasn't it on

3363
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,360
facebook it was a comment

3364
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,760
um where the comment was talking about

3365
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:38,400
hitler

3366
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,199
and it was comparing hitler and the it

3367
01:52:41,199 --> 01:52:43,040
was saying basically

3368
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,400
out of context here by the way

3369
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,840
completely out of context and i've not

3370
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,119
got the screen shot so i'm not going to

3371
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:48,880
put it up but out of out of context it

3372
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,320
was making a comparison

3373
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,719
and saying that the holocaust that

3374
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:53,679
hitler did

3375
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:56,800
had more justification than the

3376
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,040
holocaust of the animals i'm

3377
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,800
paraphrasing here it was put into a

3378
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,239
better context than that but that's

3379
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,000
that was the takeaway message that it

3380
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
was it had more justification because a

3381
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,040
book was written about

3382
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,280
it practically or have i missed a big

3383
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,639
point there but either way

3384
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:12,400
that seemed to be the take away point

3385
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,320
from it um out of context and that was

3386
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,760
obviously posted by

3387
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:17,599
i believe george in the in the

3388
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:19,760
organization on as av

3389
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,679
so like what happened with this have i

3390
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:22,960
got that wrong have people got that

3391
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:23,360
wrong

3392
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:25,520
and

3393
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,040
he's not saying that he wasn't saying

3394
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:32,480
like legitimate justifications were

3395
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:35,840
were afoot in those cases he was saying

3396
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:36,560
that

3397
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,639
more reasons were provided by hitler and

3398
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:40,800
his regime uh

3399
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,280
to the public then then the re then then

3400
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,719
what non-vegans offer

3401
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:46,960
to the public regarding the injustice

3402
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,000
that they're involved in that's what he

3403
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:48,719
was saying

3404
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:53,360
but the way that he said it lacked eq

3405
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,520
you got to have iq george is a smart guy

3406
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,360
but you got to have eq2 you got to read

3407
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,280
the room and not be an idiot about how

3408
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:01,119
you communicate emotionally

3409
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:03,119
uh so that's the thing it wasn't clear

3410
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:05,040
enough the communication we identified

3411
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:06,239
as something that needs to be improved

3412
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:07,599
and that's why we

3413
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:10,719
addressed the whole

3414
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:13,760
blm post to begin with

3415
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,520
uh the way that we did it was about the

3416
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,040
communication

3417
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:19,199
um and we still feel justified in

3418
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:20,239
addressing

3419
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:22,320
what we addressed and we will continue

3420
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:23,520
to do so

3421
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:28,080
but um i think you know sometimes

3422
01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:31,920
yeah the issue there was um

3423
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,840
sometimes there is bias that's brought

3424
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,679
into the work

3425
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:40,400
that people are doing within ab

3426
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,000
they bring their own biases whether

3427
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,520
they're political or

3428
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,840
otherwise in the way that they

3429
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:46,639
communicate

3430
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:49,360
and people need to remember if they're

3431
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,360
working with av they're representing ap

3432
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:52,000
just like

3433
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
with any other org or group that they're

3434
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,119
working with

3435
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:59,679
and when you're representing us

3436
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:03,199
we don't want that and you know he also

3437
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:07,040
did admit to doing this himself um so

3438
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:10,080
it's not just an opinion that we had

3439
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,719
this was really happening and that that

3440
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:13,920
was the issue that you're pointing out

3441
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,599
david

3442
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:18,320
sure and and george and another

3443
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:19,520
individual they were

3444
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,880
removed from the team was was that

3445
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:23,199
because of this specific example or was

3446
01:55:23,199 --> 01:55:24,159
there another reason that these

3447
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:26,159
individuals were removed

3448
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:27,360
there was another question somebody

3449
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:30,320
asked that was one of the comments

3450
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:33,920
but there were other comments left

3451
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,880
um by george but also it was the

3452
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,960
conversations we had in private with

3453
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:39,280
them

3454
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,760
about the issue i believe the comments

3455
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:43,119
were about

3456
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:45,599
um denying that systemic oppression

3457
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:47,119
exists

3458
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:49,840
and how that comment was left by our

3459
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:51,679
social media

3460
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:55,199
members without them running it by us

3461
01:55:55,199 --> 01:55:59,679
and that's not something that um

3462
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:02,480
just didn't align with us or av or other

3463
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:04,239
team members so that's why

3464
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:06,480
we had to have private conversations to

3465
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,719
clarify this and that

3466
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:10,080
and during those conversations we

3467
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,560
realized that we're just not aligned

3468
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,639
and it was just not possible at that

3469
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:17,280
point to have them on the team

3470
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,760
yeah just to clarify yeah because it

3471
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,360
might be confused by people

3472
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,080
in what we're saying here uh that like

3473
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,679
gemma and george were

3474
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:27,920
like fired on the same premise they

3475
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,159
weren't removed from av

3476
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:31,520
on the same premise there was a

3477
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,000
different uh scenario for those both

3478
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,199
individuals like we

3479
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:37,679
a different decision process for both

3480
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,199
those individuals there were different

3481
01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:40,800
things that occurred with george as well

3482
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,800
it wasn't just one thing it wasn't one

3483
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:43,520
comment

3484
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:46,239
or one point multiple comments and then

3485
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:48,239
multiple conversations that we were

3486
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,000
having that

3487
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
made it clear that yeah but it was

3488
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,040
different

3489
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,119
and and it wasn't just this no i was

3490
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:57,520
like another example was about

3491
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,080
how because the comment that you just

3492
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,000
read out i didn't remember that one but

3493
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,679
i know there was another one

3494
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:08,000
going around what our team said

3495
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,040
systemic oppression doesn't exist in the

3496
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,880
west or something like that which

3497
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,119
we were getting lots of messages about

3498
01:57:15,119 --> 01:57:17,119
and so i do remember that very clearly

3499
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:18,400
right there were i think there were

3500
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,520
multiple things

3501
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:21,920
otherwise we wouldn't just ask someone

3502
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,360
to leave the team over one

3503
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,760
comment especially someone who was an

3504
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:27,119
asset to the organization

3505
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:30,560
george was a prized member of the team

3506
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,520
whom i really liked working with and i

3507
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:34,719
thought that he was a great

3508
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:38,719
member so it's ridiculous that we would

3509
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:40,560
um yeah it's tough to be in this

3510
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:42,880
position um

3511
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,159
you know that's the thing also like

3512
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:49,440
it sucks to have to fire someone like

3513
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,639
george yeah i just want to add because

3514
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:54,080
it's okay to have

3515
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:56,320
your own political views your religious

3516
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:57,280
views

3517
01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:00,960
but if you are commenting as a v

3518
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:03,920
as a part of the team and then those

3519
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,040
views are coming

3520
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,440
through your comments and your messages

3521
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,880
then that's not okay

3522
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,880
because within the team like i said we

3523
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:12,960
have over 20 people or something

3524
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:15,360
and we all have different views and then

3525
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:17,599
we have our own political views or our

3526
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:18,320
own

3527
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,119
views on god or religion or whatever but

3528
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:22,239
you never see us

3529
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:23,760
commenting about it when we're

3530
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,760
commenting as a v because

3531
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:28,560
av is supposed to represent something

3532
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,080
that is just about the animal so

3533
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,920
regardless of your views you can be a

3534
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:33,199
part of that and

3535
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:35,360
that was the issue that it was just not

3536
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:37,679
possible to

3537
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,599
to have that with those individuals and

3538
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,119
people don't seem to be

3539
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:44,239
wanting to work with us to create

3540
01:58:44,239 --> 01:58:47,440
the most conducive organization

3541
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,119
that is dedicated to the animals

3542
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:52,800
people don't seem to be working with us

3543
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,159
to achieve this

3544
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:55,840
we seem to be dedicated to it and

3545
01:58:55,840 --> 01:58:57,360
everyone seems to be pushing back and

3546
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:00,719
pushing back and pushing back

3547
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:03,679
we are open to ideas we want to see how

3548
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:04,880
we can help

3549
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:07,920
other like other things here but

3550
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,760
we have like us i was saying we have

3551
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,440
other people in the organization

3552
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:13,599
who have even stronger political views

3553
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:14,480
than george do

3554
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:17,760
than george does even stronger political

3555
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,599
views than than george does

3556
01:59:19,599 --> 01:59:23,440
think i mean think about that you know

3557
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:27,440
yeah sure and they don't they don't ever

3558
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:29,199
they never let their advisors come

3559
01:59:29,199 --> 01:59:30,800
through their work

3560
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,080
so that's but again when it's not to

3561
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,679
focus on just one point here because it

3562
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:37,360
wasn't just one a one-dimensional

3563
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:38,159
decision

3564
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:41,679
it was multi-dimensional and that that's

3565
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:43,360
also kind of entwined with the uh

3566
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,159
intertwined the

3567
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:46,639
with another kind of criticism i had

3568
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:47,199
about the

3569
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:49,520
comments like uh there were i don't know

3570
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:51,119
if there still are i haven't seen any

3571
01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:52,320
since this but

3572
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,480
there were quite a lot of let's say rude

3573
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,520
comments

3574
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:58,480
um on on the av social media let's say

3575
01:59:58,480 --> 01:59:58,960
like

3576
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,679
sometimes i think i even saw one someone

3577
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:04,080
said you know shut the [ __ ] up like stfu

3578
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:05,520
in a comment i personally saw that

3579
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,800
myself at one point and i was like who

3580
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:07,679
the [ __ ] said that

3581
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:08,960
you know that was quite a surprise for

3582
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:10,800
me to see um

3583
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:12,800
you know is this something that you guys

3584
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,400
stand behind are you are you okay with

3585
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:15,599
like you know going out and telling

3586
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:17,280
people like if they're being you know

3587
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:18,639
if they're acting silly or if they're

3588
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:20,880
being silly is that is that with your

3589
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:22,480
social media team are they like you know

3590
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:23,840
go and do that or was this

3591
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,599
some bad actors in the team that are now

3592
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:27,440
not doing that you know how has that

3593
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:29,040
changed i haven't seen it since you know

3594
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:30,159
it seems like when

3595
02:00:30,159 --> 02:00:32,239
the whole thing happened with george um

3596
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:33,360
it seemed after that

3597
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:35,760
that social media has been direct and

3598
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:36,400
but there's

3599
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,320
not been any of this like shut up and

3600
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,239
you know and the rude comments seem to

3601
02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:40,639
have

3602
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,440
almost stopped so it was am i right in

3603
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:44,960
assuming that that was linked or

3604
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,480
or is this something you've changed

3605
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:48,960
inside internally and now it's different

3606
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:52,159
well it's not that good it's not it's

3607
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:54,320
it's not the george it's not that george

3608
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:55,360
was just

3609
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:58,400
cursing people out using our account

3610
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:01,840
um i think

3611
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:04,000
we need to see like specific examples of

3612
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,280
where this has happened for us to

3613
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:05,760
comment

3614
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,800
more specifically about those things

3615
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:12,239
but generally

3616
02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:14,639
we don't just curse people out no we

3617
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:15,280
don't

3618
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:18,560
but we do speak in a real way and so

3619
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:20,080
sometimes you might see us calling

3620
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:21,199
someone a dick

3621
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:23,040
because they're acting like a dick and

3622
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:26,080
it's and it won't be without us

3623
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:29,280
communicating effectively you know we're

3624
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:30,800
not just calling them a dick

3625
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:34,000
and if you if you just

3626
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,679
don't be a dick yourself and just

3627
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:37,280
conclude it that way when

3628
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,199
you know there's more context involved

3629
02:01:39,199 --> 02:01:41,360
here if you read the entire comment

3630
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,360
usually you can see us responding with

3631
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:46,320
an educated a response that educates

3632
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:48,960
the viewer that the reader and we're not

3633
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,159
just

3634
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:51,840
telling them to [ __ ] off or to shut the

3635
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,520
[ __ ] up or whatever it is

3636
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:54,960
you know that's not that's not what we

3637
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:58,480
do we're we're out to edify people

3638
02:01:58,480 --> 02:01:59,920
hold them accountable when you hold

3639
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:01,360
people accountable sometimes you have to

3640
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,719
be real with them

3641
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:04,960
and you have to pull them out and say

3642
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:06,320
you're being a dick when they're being a

3643
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,239
dude

3644
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:11,760
sure and um this links in with the

3645
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:15,199
the the vegetarian drama let's let's

3646
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:16,000
call it

3647
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,599
so this is something that av does focus

3648
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:19,280
on quite a lot and sal i know you

3649
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,440
actually made a posted a video on this

3650
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:22,800
relatively recently about

3651
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:25,760
about uh vegetarians um that's a that's

3652
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:26,080
a

3653
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:27,920
another big criticism that the criticism

3654
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:29,440
being that av is

3655
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,960
av attacks vegetarians that's the

3656
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:32,880
criticism like that that's come up

3657
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,800
a lot actually and i've seen that not

3658
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:35,920
only in my own

3659
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:37,760
you know me asking people for questions

3660
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:39,520
but also when you're just scrolling and

3661
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:40,639
if you're in reddit or something like

3662
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:42,080
that one of the common things that comes

3663
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:42,880
up is like av

3664
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,840
is counterproductive because they attack

3665
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:46,000
vegetarians

3666
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:47,520
um i think i already know how you're

3667
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,440
gonna answer this but um

3668
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,119
maybe a bit of an easier one to deal

3669
02:02:51,119 --> 02:02:52,719
with what do you respond to these people

3670
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:54,000
who get upset about that

3671
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,599
and say you're attacking vegetarians

3672
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:01,440
which vegetarian we've never targeted a

3673
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,679
specific vegetarian

3674
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:06,960
we attack vegetarianism and i think

3675
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,840
that vegetarianism is the single

3676
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:11,360
greatest cancer in the animal rights

3677
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,000
movement

3678
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,840
other than vegans themselves

3679
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:18,320
being number one actually vegans vegans

3680
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,400
are number one the number one threat

3681
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,400
to the animal rights movement uh

3682
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:23,760
vegetarians

3683
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:27,280
are operating in society under this idea

3684
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:27,679
this

3685
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:29,920
image of being on the side of the

3686
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,440
animals

3687
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:32,880
to be there they're portraying

3688
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,480
themselves as animal people quote

3689
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,480
unquote right

3690
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,880
and whenever they speak to vegans

3691
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:41,119
generally speaking of course

3692
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:43,440
majority of these individuals are

3693
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:44,320
pompous

3694
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,239
and they tell you that you don't need to

3695
02:03:46,239 --> 02:03:48,400
talk to them because they're already

3696
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,440
vegetarian

3697
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,360
is the way that they would frame it i'm

3698
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:53,360
already vegetarian

3699
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:56,800
so these people on paper in terms of the

3700
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:57,760
facts

3701
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:59,599
are doing exactly as much as someone

3702
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:01,840
whose paleo is doing for the animals

3703
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:03,599
because they don't consume dairy

3704
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:06,480
vegetarians don't consume flesh dairy is

3705
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:07,280
considered

3706
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:09,760
more cruel to cows than eating their

3707
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:10,560
flesh is

3708
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,840
the dairy industry we as animal rights

3709
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:15,760
activists tend to say this stuff

3710
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:18,639
so it's not just me saying that so if

3711
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:20,079
that's the case

3712
02:04:20,079 --> 02:04:22,000
paleo people are more in alignment with

3713
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,520
us than vegetarians are

3714
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:29,360
but that logic is flawed so

3715
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:33,119
it's insane that they would get a pass

3716
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:36,560
for being portrayed as animal people and

3717
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,679
as long as they continue to parade and

3718
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:40,560
act like they

3719
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,599
are animal people the longer it will

3720
02:04:43,599 --> 02:04:46,639
take to get vegetarians to become vegan

3721
02:04:46,639 --> 02:04:49,440
and the more we make a mockery of the

3722
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,440
real animal rights message for everybody

3723
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:53,440
else

3724
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:54,960
and the longer the vegans cuddle

3725
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:57,520
vegetarians

3726
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:59,440
and again i'm not talking about any

3727
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:01,679
specific vegetarian

3728
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:03,679
talking about vegetarianism the longer

3729
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:06,400
we cuddle vegetarianism

3730
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:07,920
the longer it will take for animal

3731
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:09,520
rights to be taken seriously in the

3732
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:12,159
public eye

3733
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:13,920
i think i can't remember which one of

3734
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,599
you said it or if it actually was one of

3735
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:16,079
you but

3736
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:19,280
um there was a quote that vegetarians

3737
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,360
are contributing to one less form of

3738
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:23,440
animal abuse than a meat-eater

3739
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:25,199
uh they contribute to every other form

3740
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:27,040
of animal abuse it's just not

3741
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,199
just not meat just not flesh and that

3742
02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:30,719
that was quite for me that was very

3743
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:32,239
powerful and i feel like that

3744
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:33,679
that was that was a quote that was a

3745
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:35,119
sentence that really brought it home to

3746
02:05:35,119 --> 02:05:36,320
me that actually yeah

3747
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:38,639
we we we should be targeting

3748
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:40,480
vegetarianism

3749
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,760
as you know just the same as we would

3750
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,000
target anyone else you know who's a

3751
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,280
non-vegan because it's just it's just

3752
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:46,239
there's only one

3753
02:05:46,239 --> 02:05:48,880
between them even more yeah even more

3754
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:49,520
because

3755
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,280
non-vegans don't say you don't need to

3756
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:54,159
talk to me unknown

3757
02:05:54,159 --> 02:05:56,079
they know that they need that's the

3758
02:05:56,079 --> 02:05:57,760
correct conversation to have with them

3759
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,159
they know that they're culpable

3760
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:01,840
right it's the same as someone who's

3761
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,440
non-vegan who doesn't support animal

3762
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,280
testing they never buy cosmetics

3763
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:08,239
that are tested on on animals i mean

3764
02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:09,920
they don't support one form of animal

3765
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,159
injustice yeah there are many non-vegans

3766
02:06:12,159 --> 02:06:15,520
they don't claim that claim to be exempt

3767
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:16,960
from the message regarding meat dairy

3768
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:17,840
and eggs

3769
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:19,840
vegetarians do claim to be exempt from

3770
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,599
hearing that

3771
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:24,000
yeah it's just very counterproductive to

3772
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,880
separate

3773
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:27,520
like vegetarians and the rest of

3774
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,440
non-vegans

3775
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,840
because i see that a lot from vegans and

3776
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:33,360
animal rights activists they think that

3777
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:34,560
they should get a different treatment

3778
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:36,000
but really vegetarians are just

3779
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
non-vegan so let's not separate them

3780
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,159
the reason why we focus on it is because

3781
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:41,760
we want to change their mentality it's

3782
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:44,000
not because there is any difference you

3783
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,040
know we're not

3784
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,119
like singling them out it's the same

3785
02:06:47,119 --> 02:06:48,560
it's just non-vegans

3786
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,040
it's just clarifying the message yeah on

3787
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:53,199
behalf of the animals

3788
02:06:53,199 --> 02:06:56,880
okay perfect yeah i yeah this for me was

3789
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:58,239
an easy topic because i'm

3790
02:06:58,239 --> 02:07:00,639
i also uh focus on vegetarians for the

3791
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:01,360
same reasons

3792
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:03,440
um i think i think it's something our

3793
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:04,639
movement really needs to

3794
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:05,840
needs to shape people need to shake

3795
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:07,280
their head on this and just realize that

3796
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,960
these vegetarians they're not helping us

3797
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:10,320
they're not our allies

3798
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:13,360
um understanding veganism doesn't help

3799
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:15,360
anyone like oh i understand you or i'm

3800
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:17,040
supportive of you i'm a vegetarian

3801
02:07:17,040 --> 02:07:19,119
it doesn't mean [ __ ] and i think the

3802
02:07:19,119 --> 02:07:20,320
more we start to

3803
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:23,040
realize that the better and the easier

3804
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,199
things are going to be in the long term

3805
02:07:25,199 --> 02:07:28,480
um so a style actually i have a specific

3806
02:07:28,480 --> 02:07:30,320
topic for you and this was this was

3807
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,320
actually only brought up yesterday

3808
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,400
um so that's why i don't know if you got

3809
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,360
chance to

3810
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:39,040
um yeah i'll i'll i'll explain it now so

3811
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:41,040
basically the impossible burger

3812
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,119
all right uh you did your video when

3813
02:07:43,119 --> 02:07:44,719
when was it earlier this year i don't

3814
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:45,840
know if you've thought about it since

3815
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:46,639
then

3816
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:49,280
but um i think it's been like two years

3817
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:49,920
now

3818
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:52,239
is it two years wow okay i don't know i

3819
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:54,320
watched it only recently anyway so i

3820
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:55,599
don't know if you've had chance to

3821
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:57,840
catch up on on that and or if you still

3822
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:58,719
think the same

3823
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:00,400
but um somebody brought this up and

3824
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:01,599
they're very passionate about it and

3825
02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:02,560
they wanted to

3826
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:05,520
uh discuss this um apparently according

3827
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:07,040
to them again don't know if this is true

3828
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:07,520
or not

3829
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:10,560
a lot of people left or at least stopped

3830
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,920
going to cubes or

3831
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,400
even some chapters maybe even closed

3832
02:08:14,400 --> 02:08:14,960
over

3833
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:16,719
a disagreement about the impossible

3834
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:18,400
burger and the video that you made

3835
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:20,719
i watched the video obviously i watched

3836
02:08:20,719 --> 02:08:22,480
the video i i only watched it yesterday

3837
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:23,840
so it's fresh in my mind

3838
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,520
um and your position's on the impossible

3839
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:27,119
burger and i you know

3840
02:08:27,119 --> 02:08:29,040
went through it um what what how do you

3841
02:08:29,040 --> 02:08:31,520
respond to people who who have this

3842
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:33,440
like they don't believe that av is

3843
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:35,520
abolitionist because of

3844
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:37,760
you being the founder holding the view

3845
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:38,560
that you hold that

3846
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:41,679
uh an impossible burger um is

3847
02:08:41,679 --> 02:08:43,840
it's it's vegan because they tested on

3848
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:44,880
animals um

3849
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:47,119
i'll i'll explain the video if you want

3850
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:48,079
really quickly for anyone that's

3851
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:49,280
watching real quick i watched it

3852
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:50,000
yesterday so it's really

3853
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,159
fresh in the video asal basically makes

3854
02:08:52,159 --> 02:08:53,920
the position makes the claim i don't

3855
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:56,480
know takes the position that

3856
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:58,079
practically every single e number and

3857
02:08:58,079 --> 02:08:59,520
additive has been tested on animals at

3858
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:00,320
one point

3859
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,320
so pretty much every vegan product you

3860
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:03,679
would buy has

3861
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:05,199
has something in it that has been tested

3862
02:09:05,199 --> 02:09:06,800
on animals but not by the company that

3863
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:08,239
you're buying it from

3864
02:09:08,239 --> 02:09:10,000
uh the impossible burger and possible

3865
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,159
foods did the testing themselves

3866
02:09:12,159 --> 02:09:14,239
and but the product now that's in the

3867
02:09:14,239 --> 02:09:16,639
store technically hasn't been tested on

3868
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:18,320
it's the product that the one thing that

3869
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,400
was in it was previously tested

3870
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:21,920
so therefore it's in the same category

3871
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,760
as another item that you would buy

3872
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,920
um they're both been tested at some

3873
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:26,800
point

3874
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,719
um and if you take issue with the

3875
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:30,159
impossible burger

3876
02:09:30,159 --> 02:09:32,480
then how long does it have to be before

3877
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:33,920
we don't take issue with it anymore and

3878
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:35,360
it becomes in the same category as the

3879
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:36,239
other products

3880
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:38,079
that have were once tested on animals

3881
02:09:38,079 --> 02:09:39,760
that's the position that a cell takes

3882
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:42,400
so if anyone's got a question about that

3883
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,000
either super chat it or save it for

3884
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:44,719
later

3885
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:45,840
but yeah how do you how would you

3886
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,840
respond to someone now who says right

3887
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:50,159
that that makes av non-abolitionist

3888
02:09:50,159 --> 02:09:51,280
because av

3889
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:53,119
is supporting a product that was tested

3890
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:54,800
on animals and they take the position

3891
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,239
that because impossible foods did the

3892
02:09:56,239 --> 02:09:57,119
testing

3893
02:09:57,119 --> 02:09:59,199
and they have not actually said they

3894
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:01,040
wouldn't test the gain so impossible

3895
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:03,679
said they will test again if they feel

3896
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:04,480
that they

3897
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:06,560
they say need to but let's be honest we

3898
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:08,159
don't need that burger right

3899
02:10:08,159 --> 02:10:11,119
um so they say they would do it again

3900
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:12,400
and some people are saying because of

3901
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:13,119
that the av

3902
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:14,560
is not abolitionist and that's why they

3903
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:16,480
don't want to work with av anymore

3904
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:18,639
how do you what do you think of that

3905
02:10:18,639 --> 02:10:20,159
well i just think that

3906
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:23,599
to be consistent um

3907
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:25,840
exactly what you said if we are

3908
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:28,480
consuming products that at one time

3909
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,880
in the past they were tested or an

3910
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,480
ingredient was tested

3911
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:36,000
we also use many products that um

3912
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,719
again were either tested or they are

3913
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:41,280
produced by a company that is not vegan

3914
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:44,079
and you know like we can just keep going

3915
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:46,000
down this rabbit hole but

3916
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,159
ultimately to be consistent with the

3917
02:10:48,159 --> 02:10:49,360
values that we have

3918
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:51,760
i think it's okay to say that if you're

3919
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:53,679
vegan and you eat the impossible burger

3920
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:55,199
you're not suddenly not vegan that's

3921
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:56,480
literally what i was saying i wasn't

3922
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:58,159
promoting it necessarily but i was

3923
02:10:58,159 --> 02:10:58,960
saying

3924
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:02,079
um the impossible burger is as vegan

3925
02:11:02,079 --> 02:11:04,719
as the beyond burger because one of the

3926
02:11:04,719 --> 02:11:06,400
things that i don't think i mentioned in

3927
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:07,280
that video

3928
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:08,639
and i think it's something that i

3929
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:10,880
actually learned after doing that video

3930
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:11,679
was that

3931
02:11:11,679 --> 02:11:13,840
when they were working on the beyond

3932
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:14,800
burger

3933
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:17,360
they were buying burgers made of cow

3934
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:17,840
flesh

3935
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:20,320
and they were testing them or they were

3936
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:21,199
maybe

3937
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:23,920
just having a tasting session or

3938
02:11:23,920 --> 02:11:25,679
whatever to get the texture or the

3939
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:27,360
flavors right so

3940
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:28,880
i don't see any difference between the

3941
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:32,480
two um in one scenario cows are being

3942
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,079
murdered for the burgers and in the

3943
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:36,239
other scenario mice are being murdered

3944
02:11:36,239 --> 02:11:38,079
because they're being tested on so

3945
02:11:38,079 --> 02:11:40,880
i just see them exactly the same they're

3946
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:42,320
just different animals that are being

3947
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:43,920
used in the process but

3948
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:46,079
i just think to be consistent you either

3949
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:47,119
have to say

3950
02:11:47,119 --> 02:11:49,280
i don't use anything that was ever

3951
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:50,239
tested or

3952
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:53,199
is ever coming from a company that uses

3953
02:11:53,199 --> 02:11:55,360
animals or uses animal testing

3954
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:57,119
or you're just going to have to accept

3955
02:11:57,119 --> 02:11:59,840
that we do live in a non-vegan world and

3956
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,760
as much as possible yes sure you can

3957
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:02,880
avoid it but

3958
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:05,280
i just don't see the difference between

3959
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,000
like i said that

3960
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,520
product and other products that we're

3961
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:10,000
using um like to beyond virgo which

3962
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,400
nobody has ever taken an issue with i

3963
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,639
haven't seen it

3964
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:17,760
and if i can just add to this argument

3965
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:20,400
that we as an organization have made

3966
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:21,280
essentially

3967
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:25,760
regarding this topic uh

3968
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:28,560
the only arguments i've ever heard from

3969
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:29,599
those who are

3970
02:12:29,599 --> 02:12:32,639
trying to damn us

3971
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:35,440
by uh saying that we're not like we're

3972
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,360
not we're not abolitionists because we

3973
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:39,119
hold this position

3974
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:40,560
the only argument i see coming from

3975
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,239
these people

3976
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:46,079
is an argument for how impossible foods

3977
02:12:46,079 --> 02:12:48,239
as a company is not vegan

3978
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:51,119
to which we totally agree with the

3979
02:12:51,119 --> 02:12:53,360
company is not vegan

3980
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:57,360
the product itself however is vegan

3981
02:12:57,360 --> 02:12:59,520
and that's why sales made the

3982
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,560
distinction

3983
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:03,040
between this and any other company that

3984
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:05,199
sells a vegan product

3985
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:07,280
a non-vegan company selling a vegan

3986
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:09,599
product has always

3987
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:13,119
been a product that vegans

3988
02:13:13,119 --> 02:13:14,960
consume and are still considered to be

3989
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:16,880
vegan when they consume it

3990
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:19,920
uh and we don't you know when you said

3991
02:13:19,920 --> 02:13:21,119
we don't we don't need the impossible

3992
02:13:21,119 --> 02:13:22,639
burger that the same could be said for

3993
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:24,320
every other product

3994
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:27,520
that exists on the shelf so where do you

3995
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:28,960
draw the line

3996
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:31,760
and how do we make veganism practical

3997
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,040
for people

3998
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:35,199
by saying you can only support vegan

3999
02:13:35,199 --> 02:13:36,400
companies

4000
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:37,840
if you're only supporting vegan

4001
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:39,920
companies in this

4002
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:42,960
modern world we live in i don't think

4003
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,239
veganism is possible

4004
02:13:44,239 --> 02:13:45,920
that's it's actually i think an

4005
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:47,679
irresponsible message

4006
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:50,960
if we care about animal liberation

4007
02:13:50,960 --> 02:13:53,920
yeah so there's two points i'd like to

4008
02:13:53,920 --> 02:13:55,440
push on a little bit further with this

4009
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:56,079
um

4010
02:13:56,079 --> 02:13:58,800
one of them being that what do you think

4011
02:13:58,800 --> 02:13:59,520
about

4012
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:01,199
this is this these are this is internal

4013
02:14:01,199 --> 02:14:03,040
okay i'm with you and i think that i

4014
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:04,239
just want to put this point away

4015
02:14:04,239 --> 02:14:04,960
actually

4016
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,880
that this will not in my opinion what we

4017
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,400
are discussing here is the message we

4018
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:09,520
put out to the public

4019
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:11,360
because i don't believe that that's it's

4020
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:12,719
it's going to be in any way

4021
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:14,800
uh beneficial for us to slam the

4022
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:15,840
impossible burger

4023
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,760
to the non-vegan public right that

4024
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:19,440
doesn't make any sense um

4025
02:14:19,440 --> 02:14:22,239
whatever they tested it on animals yeah

4026
02:14:22,239 --> 02:14:23,360
it's [ __ ]

4027
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:26,239
but um it's making tracks with

4028
02:14:26,239 --> 02:14:28,320
non-vegans and it's it's

4029
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:30,079
i don't know it's it's i feel like it's

4030
02:14:30,079 --> 02:14:31,440
more of an internal thing that

4031
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:33,679
that we discuss in this like as part of

4032
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:35,119
the animal rights movement

4033
02:14:35,119 --> 02:14:36,960
should this be an accepted thing like

4034
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:38,560
into the movement or into veganism

4035
02:14:38,560 --> 02:14:39,840
should this burger be accepted should

4036
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:41,040
these products be accepted i feel like

4037
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:42,719
that's what we're discussing more than

4038
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:45,920
a public statement um and that being

4039
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:46,639
said

4040
02:14:46,639 --> 02:14:48,079
so a company like i mean that's where i

4041
02:14:48,079 --> 02:14:49,360
stand on it anyway that's why i don't

4042
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:49,679
really

4043
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:51,040
i don't want to get into like should we

4044
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:52,560
talk about it you know pushing it to the

4045
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:54,159
public or not i don't really think

4046
02:14:54,159 --> 02:14:56,800
advertising vegan consumerism is i don't

4047
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,000
really agree with that anyway i'm not

4048
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,679
posting about subways vegan option or

4049
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:02,639
mcdonald's vegan options

4050
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:06,079
has never done yeah no i know that's

4051
02:15:06,079 --> 02:15:07,679
yeah i think we're on the same page with

4052
02:15:07,679 --> 02:15:09,040
that that's why i just i think we can

4053
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:10,560
just kind of go on because i don't

4054
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:12,400
i don't like that i see others doing it

4055
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,000
i'm like okay cool but

4056
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,679
it doesn't sit right for me to promote

4057
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:17,520
these massive monster companies

4058
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,639
uh it doesn't feel right um but but if

4059
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:22,239
people do it that's their call right

4060
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,000
it's not for me my point i was going to

4061
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:25,679
make though with this is that

4062
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:27,599
so for example quorn is a massive

4063
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:28,880
company in the uk i don't know if

4064
02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:29,360
they're in

4065
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:31,040
australia too but they uh they're one of

4066
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:32,800
the oh cool so like the og

4067
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:35,520
like um fake meat mock meat companies

4068
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,239
and

4069
02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:37,360
they they have this thing called

4070
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:39,040
microprotein and that was tested on

4071
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:40,719
animals when they first released it

4072
02:15:40,719 --> 02:15:43,040
but the pushback was so intense and from

4073
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:44,159
vegetarians

4074
02:15:44,159 --> 02:15:47,440
that they had to like reconvene

4075
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:48,880
and they released a statement where

4076
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:50,880
basically the uh i think it was the ceo

4077
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,239
i can't remember it's on their website

4078
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:53,040
right now

4079
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:56,719
um he basically says that he he regrets

4080
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:57,119
it

4081
02:15:57,119 --> 02:15:58,320
that he wishes that he did it

4082
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:00,159
differently or she i can't remember if

4083
02:16:00,159 --> 02:16:01,199
it's a guy or a girl

4084
02:16:01,199 --> 02:16:02,719
and they said they will never test on

4085
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:04,239
animals ever again this company will

4086
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:05,520
never do it ever again

4087
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:07,199
and uh we totally listen to your

4088
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:08,719
feedback and it's done

4089
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:11,679
um versus unfortunately the impossible

4090
02:16:11,679 --> 02:16:12,400
burger

4091
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,079
impossible foods and i think beyond

4092
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:15,840
foods as well i think beyond me also

4093
02:16:15,840 --> 02:16:17,760
say this they're saying the opposite

4094
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:18,639
like they're saying they're going to

4095
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:20,159
continue to test

4096
02:16:20,159 --> 02:16:21,840
for me and for many i think that's where

4097
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:23,360
they draw the line and say wait a minute

4098
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,360
okay testing once is one thing

4099
02:16:25,360 --> 02:16:27,360
testing once and saying yeah we see

4100
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,639
you're pissed off and we know it's wrong

4101
02:16:28,639 --> 02:16:29,920
but we're going to do it again if we

4102
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:32,080
if we want to they they draw a

4103
02:16:32,080 --> 02:16:33,760
distinction between these two companies

4104
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,359
and one being like okay we'll support

4105
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:35,920
this one

4106
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:37,040
and the other one they say no we're not

4107
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:37,920
going to support them because they're

4108
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,439
pro with a section

4109
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:41,359
you know where do you stand on on that

4110
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:44,080
comparison that logic doesn't work

4111
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:47,519
that logic does not work because corn is

4112
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:49,280
still selling products with cheese and

4113
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:50,160
egg in it

4114
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:52,879
um or at least egg yeah they have a

4115
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:54,959
vegetarian range and a vegan brain

4116
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:56,799
so yeah okay they're against animal

4117
02:16:56,799 --> 02:16:58,398
testing they're still not a vegan

4118
02:16:58,398 --> 02:16:59,599
company however

4119
02:16:59,599 --> 02:17:01,760
yeah in exactly the same way that

4120
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:04,240
impossible foods is not a vegan company

4121
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:07,920
so sure bad comparison then yeah

4122
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:11,359
yeah well no it's just people are

4123
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:12,879
getting angry about what they choose to

4124
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:15,040
be angry about

4125
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:17,439
yeah i think it's about being consistent

4126
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:19,040
that's a great point because they're not

4127
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:20,879
a vegan company and the whole range is

4128
02:17:20,879 --> 02:17:21,920
not vegan so

4129
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:24,558
why are we only taking issue with animal

4130
02:17:24,558 --> 02:17:25,920
testing and not what

4131
02:17:25,920 --> 02:17:27,519
happens to the animals in the dairy egg

4132
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:29,200
industry

4133
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:31,120
sure sure it's about that's my bad

4134
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:32,718
that's a bad comparison with corn

4135
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:34,240
um i guess what i was trying to get at

4136
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:36,080
is is uh we've

4137
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:37,599
supported a company that is going to say

4138
02:17:37,599 --> 02:17:38,718
that they're going to continue to test

4139
02:17:38,718 --> 02:17:39,599
on animals but

4140
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:42,799
is producing um plant-based burgers

4141
02:17:42,799 --> 02:17:45,519
like is is there no is is there no

4142
02:17:45,519 --> 02:17:47,040
ethical consideration to be hard here i

4143
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:49,519
guess is what i'm trying to say

4144
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:52,000
of course come on man of course there it

4145
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:52,959
is

4146
02:17:52,959 --> 02:17:55,679
of course of course we need to ask

4147
02:17:55,679 --> 02:17:57,040
impossible foods

4148
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:59,679
to cut the [ __ ] and stop testing on

4149
02:17:59,679 --> 02:18:01,599
animals and to be vegan

4150
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:04,638
but the point here is that expecting

4151
02:18:04,638 --> 02:18:05,679
them to be

4152
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:08,160
vegan before you buy their product which

4153
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:10,718
is vegan stand alone

4154
02:18:10,718 --> 02:18:14,240
in and of itself is just a ridiculous

4155
02:18:14,240 --> 02:18:17,599
uh standard to apply if you're going to

4156
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:19,280
do it you have to be consistent and that

4157
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:20,799
would make it impractical to be

4158
02:18:20,799 --> 02:18:22,959
impractical to be vegan it would make it

4159
02:18:22,959 --> 02:18:24,879
impossible to be vegan

4160
02:18:24,879 --> 02:18:28,080
and i don't mean to use that pun

4161
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:31,359
but we're in an impossible situation

4162
02:18:31,359 --> 02:18:35,120
sure okay okay um

4163
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:36,318
yeah i think that's all i wanted to ask

4164
02:18:36,318 --> 02:18:37,120
about that i don't think there's

4165
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:38,558
anything else i can go through

4166
02:18:38,558 --> 02:18:40,240
do you have anything to close on that

4167
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:41,679
with it being mainly

4168
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:43,120
the questions targeted at you is there

4169
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:44,240
anything else you'd like to say to

4170
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:45,200
people who are still

4171
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:47,840
like dubious about this or unsure about

4172
02:18:47,840 --> 02:18:48,638
this

4173
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:50,558
i think that's it just the last point

4174
02:18:50,558 --> 02:18:52,240
that you said about

4175
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:54,240
um you know how they've they've

4176
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:56,799
basically said they will test

4177
02:18:56,799 --> 02:19:00,318
in the future and then coin saying

4178
02:19:00,318 --> 02:19:02,240
they will never do it again i just think

4179
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:04,558
i personally on a personal level

4180
02:19:04,558 --> 02:19:08,080
i don't take that seriously anyway just

4181
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:09,679
because the ceo came out and said

4182
02:19:09,679 --> 02:19:10,240
something

4183
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:12,160
i don't take it either way i don't take

4184
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:13,359
it as

4185
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:15,519
seriously as others actually forget

4186
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:17,599
because i just think okay i'll just wait

4187
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:18,638
and see

4188
02:19:18,638 --> 02:19:21,200
in future if impossible keeps doing it

4189
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:22,000
then

4190
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,359
i will not be supporting it anymore or

4191
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:27,760
um at the same time i don't trust that

4192
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:29,760
company that says we will never do it

4193
02:19:29,760 --> 02:19:30,240
again

4194
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:31,840
i just don't trust people like that

4195
02:19:31,840 --> 02:19:33,280
because they might do it and

4196
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:35,040
at the same time they are abusing other

4197
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,879
animals anyway so that's why

4198
02:19:36,879 --> 02:19:39,280
like somebody just making a statement on

4199
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,280
their website is not

4200
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,120
i don't take it that's here no one no

4201
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:44,558
one is protesting

4202
02:19:44,558 --> 02:19:47,439
magnums the vegan magnums the company

4203
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:50,000
whether they put out a statement or not

4204
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,040
uh are saying in their actions that

4205
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:55,920
they do not reject animal abuse that

4206
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:57,600
they will continue to condone it

4207
02:19:57,600 --> 02:19:59,840
and sell products and make money off the

4208
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:00,960
backs of animals

4209
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:02,399
because just look at the rest of their

4210
02:20:02,399 --> 02:20:04,160
range same could be said

4211
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:06,640
about cliff bars same could be said

4212
02:20:06,640 --> 02:20:07,200
about

4213
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,439
literally every other product that we as

4214
02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:12,399
vegans consume

4215
02:20:12,399 --> 02:20:15,359
and these companies that they come from

4216
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:17,120
are not vegan companies

4217
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:20,560
so it's just asinine to expect this uh

4218
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:23,280
from impossible like just because you

4219
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:24,319
eat their burger

4220
02:20:24,319 --> 02:20:25,840
it doesn't mean you condone them as a

4221
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,840
company if that's the case you're

4222
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:30,960
condoning every company you ever

4223
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:33,600
purchase anything from but you're really

4224
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:35,280
just condoning that product

4225
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:38,800
you're really just buying a product yeah

4226
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,080
and then to people that take that

4227
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,359
position and some people do take that

4228
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:42,640
position that by buying the product

4229
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:43,200
you're

4230
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:46,560
in the company um and um and it's like

4231
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:47,760
you said i think it's

4232
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:51,120
practically impossible uh to do that but

4233
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:53,120
then they would argue that okay but

4234
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,200
it's not it's practically impossible but

4235
02:20:55,200 --> 02:20:56,960
then surely that that's that's the same

4236
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:58,399
as saying it's practically impossible to

4237
02:20:58,399 --> 02:20:59,359
be vegan

4238
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:00,800
but we're just doing the best we can and

4239
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:02,479
we're going to make extra efforts to not

4240
02:21:02,479 --> 02:21:03,760
buy from companies that we know

4241
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:05,680
are are really bad though what do you

4242
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,280
think that would be

4243
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:08,800
an incorrect statement because that

4244
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:10,479
would suggest a different definition of

4245
02:21:10,479 --> 02:21:11,439
veganism

4246
02:21:11,439 --> 02:21:15,359
veganism is literally defined by

4247
02:21:15,359 --> 02:21:16,880
avoiding animal abuse as much as

4248
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:20,240
practically possible it's not practical

4249
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:22,240
to carry out veganism in the way that

4250
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:24,560
it's being suggested in in all this

4251
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:25,280
stuff

4252
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:27,439
it's just that's not practical we're not

4253
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:29,120
even talking about a scenario where you

4254
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:29,439
have

4255
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:31,840
two options in front of you one from a

4256
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:33,120
vegan company and one

4257
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,880
is an impossible burger and you have no

4258
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,399
other food options because you're on a

4259
02:21:36,399 --> 02:21:37,359
desert

4260
02:21:37,359 --> 02:21:39,439
uh you're on a deserted island or

4261
02:21:39,439 --> 02:21:40,399
something that's not

4262
02:21:40,399 --> 02:21:43,280
the scenario we're in here uh because in

4263
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:44,960
that scenario obviously the better thing

4264
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:45,680
to do

4265
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:47,520
would be to choose the product from the

4266
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:49,120
vegan company

4267
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:52,840
um but it's not as black and white as

4268
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:54,080
this

4269
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:56,240
okay cool all right we'll close that

4270
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:57,359
chapter we've got

4271
02:21:57,359 --> 02:21:59,760
just two more topics left and then we'll

4272
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:01,040
we'll go to a q a

4273
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:02,880
so um i don't know how many people are

4274
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:04,080
left from the beginning but there were a

4275
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:05,600
lot of questions coming in earlier and

4276
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:06,960
i'm not prepared to go through the chat

4277
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:08,000
to find them so

4278
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
if you have questions uh you're gonna

4279
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,680
have to save them and type them again

4280
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:12,479
when we do a quick

4281
02:22:12,479 --> 02:22:15,200
q a um and as i said if you if you're

4282
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:16,479
planning on asking questions keep it

4283
02:22:16,479 --> 02:22:18,319
sensible or we just won't answer it

4284
02:22:18,319 --> 02:22:20,560
it's a waste of your time typing it if

4285
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:22,080
you're gonna be stupid so

4286
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:24,640
just keep that in mind um all right the

4287
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:26,240
last last two points then just

4288
02:22:26,240 --> 02:22:28,319
the first one i want to talk about this

4289
02:22:28,319 --> 02:22:29,600
it's linked to something we discussed

4290
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:31,200
earlier actually about the the people

4291
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:32,960
complaining or claiming they weren't

4292
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,319
getting funded you know like they

4293
02:22:34,319 --> 02:22:35,520
weren't getting the

4294
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:38,000
av fund or whatever and it links into an

4295
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,200
overall problem of

4296
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:42,960
organizers in av getting somehow feeling

4297
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:43,439
that they

4298
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:45,280
haven't been supported or they feel like

4299
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:46,640
they haven't been supported by you or

4300
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:47,840
they feel like they've been actually had

4301
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:48,960
the opposite like some

4302
02:22:48,960 --> 02:22:50,720
some ex-organizers go out there and

4303
02:22:50,720 --> 02:22:52,000
claim that they were actually

4304
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,720
um i don't know what you would say you

4305
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:56,000
guys were rude to them or they were

4306
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,520
treated badly by av

4307
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,479
and that's why they left or or um they

4308
02:23:00,479 --> 02:23:02,399
were booted out or something

4309
02:23:02,399 --> 02:23:04,080
you know and i'm being generic here in

4310
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:05,520
general because every time i've pushed

4311
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:06,960
for more information on these

4312
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:09,280
claims i've had i've had nothing right

4313
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:11,120
so i'm bringing it up as a general topic

4314
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:12,000
and you don't need to

4315
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,680
answer it as if it's like oh this one

4316
02:23:13,680 --> 02:23:14,960
individual or something because they

4317
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:16,399
never provided me any screenshots or

4318
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:18,399
anything so i've got nothing to show you

4319
02:23:18,399 --> 02:23:21,520
um but what why are they doing this why

4320
02:23:21,520 --> 02:23:22,880
do you think this this is coming up from

4321
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:24,640
ex organizers where they're saying

4322
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:26,640
i wasn't supported or i was treated

4323
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,560
badly um

4324
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:30,000
where where is that coming from do you

4325
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,520
think there's any truth to it you know

4326
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:34,479
what are your thoughts on it

4327
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:38,160
no there's no truth to this because

4328
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:41,760
we um

4329
02:23:42,160 --> 02:23:44,560
we provide support for every chapter for

4330
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:47,040
every organizer equally

4331
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:49,120
right we've got all these different

4332
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:50,960
things and procedures and

4333
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:54,080
systems in place that provide support

4334
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:57,680
from us um to the regional organizers we

4335
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:58,800
have a manager

4336
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,439
that manages the regional organizers and

4337
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:02,399
then

4338
02:24:02,399 --> 02:24:04,399
so all of the organizers have the

4339
02:24:04,399 --> 02:24:05,840
ability to reach out to

4340
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:08,720
us personally in their chat at any

4341
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:10,800
moment if they need support if they need

4342
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:13,120
advice if they need any kind of help

4343
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:16,160
and we always help them and

4344
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:18,800
we provide support where we can so to

4345
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:21,680
just leave and say that they felt

4346
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:24,160
um like they were not supported or they

4347
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:26,080
were treated badly it's just

4348
02:24:26,080 --> 02:24:28,880
yeah we need to see the evidence because

4349
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:30,720
it's easy to just make these statements

4350
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,080
but where is it coming from

4351
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:33,760
again it's just because people think

4352
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:35,120
okay i'm going to leave av

4353
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:37,680
because all these people said paul is

4354
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:40,000
racist and this and that and so

4355
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,520
now i'm going to just jump on the

4356
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:44,800
bandwagon and say abe treated me badly

4357
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,479
that's the only thing i can think of

4358
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:48,319
there's no evidence

4359
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:50,560
right

4360
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,120
i don't think it's much of a help to

4361
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:57,520
anybody for us to comment on

4362
02:24:57,520 --> 02:24:58,880
this any further than that because

4363
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:00,720
there's no specific

4364
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:04,160
thing to that we're responding to yeah

4365
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:06,640
i'm just trying to get it you know i i

4366
02:25:06,640 --> 02:25:08,000
agree with you i don't like bringing

4367
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:08,479
this up

4368
02:25:08,479 --> 02:25:10,720
because there's no i've got nothing to

4369
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:12,240
show you know what i mean and i feel

4370
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:12,880
like

4371
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:14,560
i've had multiple conversations i've had

4372
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:15,840
conversations i'll be honest with you

4373
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:17,120
i've had conversations with people that

4374
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:19,120
i would consider to be good friends

4375
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:21,760
and i've had to be quite harsh and say

4376
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:22,240
look

4377
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:24,800
either give me something here or you're

4378
02:25:24,800 --> 02:25:25,520
full of [ __ ]

4379
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:27,680
hey i'm sorry and we've kind of like got

4380
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:28,960
into an argument and just

4381
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:30,720
agreed to disagree on it because they

4382
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:32,240
wouldn't give it to me because they

4383
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:33,439
didn't have it

4384
02:25:33,439 --> 02:25:36,000
and um so i've got to say i i hold i

4385
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,520
hold a bit of a bias on this because

4386
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:38,560
i've experienced

4387
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:40,479
the [ __ ] first hand and it's it's

4388
02:25:40,479 --> 02:25:41,920
really disappointing to see

4389
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:43,600
and it kind of happens to me as well

4390
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:45,200
obviously people say things about me and

4391
02:25:45,200 --> 02:25:46,319
i'll say okay great give me some

4392
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:47,840
evidence tell me where i've said that

4393
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:51,359
and they disappear you know um so i

4394
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:53,600
it's it's it's a it's a symptom of a

4395
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:55,200
larger problem i think

4396
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:58,479
um yeah yeah

4397
02:25:58,479 --> 02:26:01,359
for sure yeah and then the final the

4398
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:03,600
final thing we'll go into then

4399
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:05,359
is actually about the effectiveness of

4400
02:26:05,359 --> 02:26:06,960
av so this is a good thing or not just

4401
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:08,960
av but of animal rights activism of the

4402
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,399
activism that we're doing so

4403
02:26:10,399 --> 02:26:12,720
somebody did message me and they told me

4404
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:14,160
um ask them

4405
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:15,520
they started off with a shitty message

4406
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:17,520
they said ask them why why the cube of

4407
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:18,800
truth doesn't work

4408
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:20,880
so i was like okay what are you talking

4409
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:22,240
about they said right look the

4410
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:23,680
number of animals being killed is on the

4411
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:25,760
rise and um

4412
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:27,840
the challenge 22 sign ups for last year

4413
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,359
i think it was last year was only 2

4414
02:26:29,359 --> 02:26:31,680
000 in the entire world so clearly it's

4415
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:33,439
not working so i broke that down into

4416
02:26:33,439 --> 02:26:34,960
two sections and this is two things i

4417
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:36,160
want to go through like

4418
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:38,240
one side of this is that obviously if

4419
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:39,760
the number of animals being killed is

4420
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:41,040
increasing it's not just av

4421
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:42,880
that's not working it's every single

4422
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:44,319
activism group that's not working

4423
02:26:44,319 --> 02:26:45,200
because

4424
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:47,520
clearly you know save isn't working dxe

4425
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:48,800
isn't working direct action isn't

4426
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:50,080
working hunts abs aren't working

4427
02:26:50,080 --> 02:26:51,359
nothing's working because the amount of

4428
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:52,960
animals being killed is on the increase

4429
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:53,680
right

4430
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:56,319
so that's that's a topic why is that

4431
02:26:56,319 --> 02:26:56,960
happening

4432
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:58,479
um you know what can we do about it as

4433
02:26:58,479 --> 02:27:00,399
one topic and the other topic is

4434
02:27:00,399 --> 02:27:04,240
um why the um challenge the vegan 22

4435
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:06,800
av signups um they seem to be a lot

4436
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:07,439
lower than

4437
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:10,080
what would be expected of a of you know

4438
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:11,840
considering how much work goes in into

4439
02:27:11,840 --> 02:27:13,040
the cubes right

4440
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:14,399
so i think let's maybe start with the

4441
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:15,840
challenge 22 one because that might be

4442
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,280
an easier quicker one to go into and

4443
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:18,640
then we'll close on the

4444
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:20,800
on the set on the other one so what with

4445
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,399
the challenge 22 reporting

4446
02:27:22,399 --> 02:27:24,720
um firstly is that accurate like what's

4447
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:25,840
going on with that or

4448
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:27,680
how is it only at 2 000 for like the

4449
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:29,200
whole year

4450
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:31,680
nah first of all it's not accurate

4451
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:34,080
because many people wouldn't use it also

4452
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:35,920
at some point we stopped promoting it

4453
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:37,600
and using it anyway

4454
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,080
because we realized that challenge 22 is

4455
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:41,600
now really aligned with av

4456
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:44,720
in terms of how they promote veganism

4457
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:47,920
and so we stopped promoting it

4458
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:49,920
and maybe some organizers some

4459
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:51,439
volunteers are still

4460
02:27:51,439 --> 02:27:53,439
using that link when they arrest someone

4461
02:27:53,439 --> 02:27:55,600
at a cube but

4462
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,840
it's not being done the same way anyway

4463
02:27:57,840 --> 02:27:58,880
i think

4464
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:01,280
when did we start doing this when we

4465
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:02,960
when did we stop using

4466
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:06,160
the link last year at least

4467
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:08,720
a year and a half yeah wait it's it

4468
02:28:08,720 --> 02:28:10,640
could even be up to two years now but

4469
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:10,960
it's

4470
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:12,640
at least a year yeah i think it was last

4471
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:14,800
year at some point we realized that

4472
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:16,800
we're just not aligned we stopped using

4473
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:18,240
it and um

4474
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:20,399
even when we were promoting it and it

4475
02:28:20,399 --> 02:28:21,600
was on the card

4476
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:23,520
i can average someone and i can say you

4477
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:25,200
know you can go and sign up

4478
02:28:25,200 --> 02:28:28,240
and use this link but that person is not

4479
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:30,080
necessarily going to do it even if they

4480
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,920
do decide that they want to be vegan so

4481
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:33,760
that's why it's not a good measurement

4482
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:36,000
and we all the way that we communicate

4483
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,280
animal rights to people

4484
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:40,399
is so simple and easy to digest and

4485
02:28:40,399 --> 02:28:42,800
with so much personal individual

4486
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:44,960
accountability attached to it

4487
02:28:44,960 --> 02:28:48,080
that the why factor is is something we

4488
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:48,560
focus

4489
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:51,359
so heavily on hammering into people that

4490
02:28:51,359 --> 02:28:52,080
the how

4491
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:55,600
factor is something we empower

4492
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:57,920
generally we empower other the the

4493
02:28:57,920 --> 02:29:00,080
bystander to take on

4494
02:29:00,080 --> 02:29:01,600
within their accountability it's their

4495
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:03,120
responsibility to be

4496
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:06,720
to be to you know properly plan how

4497
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:08,160
they're going to be vegan by

4498
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:10,720
simply using google and we we sometimes

4499
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:12,560
say exactly that you know google is all

4500
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:13,600
you really need to be

4501
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:16,560
to be vegan uh we want it to be simple

4502
02:29:16,560 --> 02:29:18,000
for people we don't want to make it

4503
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,600
sound like you need to be in a 22-day

4504
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:20,080
program

4505
02:29:20,080 --> 02:29:22,640
when that's not even true you don't the

4506
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:23,520
fact is

4507
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:26,080
you do not need that is it helpful for

4508
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:27,120
some people

4509
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:28,720
but not for everyone and that's not the

4510
02:29:28,720 --> 02:29:30,399
message that we believe

4511
02:29:30,399 --> 02:29:32,560
is important we need to clarify it

4512
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:33,600
further by saying

4513
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:36,800
all that's needed is the why factor the

4514
02:29:36,800 --> 02:29:37,280
how

4515
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,280
you will figure out if there were vegans

4516
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:41,200
50 years ago

4517
02:29:41,200 --> 02:29:44,240
you can be vegan now

4518
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:47,120
absolutely okay i think i think that's

4519
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:48,479
i'll give you my personal opinion on

4520
02:29:48,479 --> 02:29:50,000
that as well because i think that's fair

4521
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,720
um and i think i don't know to gauge the

4522
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:53,359
success

4523
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:56,479
or or failure by how many challenge 22

4524
02:29:56,479 --> 02:29:57,680
sign ups seems a little bit

4525
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:59,760
there are seems a bit short-sighted uh

4526
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:01,920
considering that you know

4527
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:03,920
you see conversations with someone like

4528
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:05,280
you know hudson for example

4529
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,040
he was a great activist and some of his

4530
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:09,040
conversations just you blow someone's

4531
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:10,399
mind you know and

4532
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:12,240
do they sign up for vegan 22 maybe not

4533
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:14,080
but but their mind has been blown

4534
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:16,399
like you know you can't undo that like

4535
02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:18,880
maybe they don't do vegan 22 but

4536
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,399
the idea that they could potentially go

4537
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:22,319
vegan is still is still there you know

4538
02:30:22,319 --> 02:30:23,680
they've definitely

4539
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:25,760
made some connections so i think

4540
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:27,200
engaging the success

4541
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:28,800
based on that is is a little bit well

4542
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,640
not a little bit it's very short-sighted

4543
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:32,000
and it does it does bring up the

4544
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,319
question though of of how can we gauge

4545
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:35,359
success right

4546
02:30:35,359 --> 02:30:36,800
because currently this leads on to the

4547
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,720
next question that we can gauge our

4548
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:40,399
failure by the amount of animals being

4549
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:42,319
killed on the rise right so that

4550
02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:43,600
that's something i feel like we all have

4551
02:30:43,600 --> 02:30:45,439
to take as a bit of a slap in the face

4552
02:30:45,439 --> 02:30:46,319
like okay

4553
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:48,560
we're trying but you know clearly

4554
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:50,560
something isn't working as effectively

4555
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:51,680
as we'd like it to be

4556
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:54,319
or we've got a long way to go right um

4557
02:30:54,319 --> 02:30:56,319
so how can we gauge success how can we

4558
02:30:56,319 --> 02:30:57,280
know that we're

4559
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:59,680
we're working towards you know the right

4560
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:00,560
place when

4561
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:02,160
it looks like we're not if you look at

4562
02:31:02,160 --> 02:31:05,200
the global statistic

4563
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:09,200
hey look i would agree that animals and

4564
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:10,640
the animal rights movement has been

4565
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:12,479
pushed back even further this year than

4566
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:14,000
it was last year

4567
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,960
i would agree with that

4568
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:20,080
all right yeah but to say that we

4569
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:21,439
shouldn't fight for animals in the way

4570
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:23,680
that we're doing it is ridiculous

4571
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:27,439
uh i i would judge incremental wins

4572
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:30,880
by saying that you know in our network

4573
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:31,680
i'm seeing

4574
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:34,399
more and more people than ever before

4575
02:31:34,399 --> 02:31:35,200
speaking

4576
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:36,880
correctly about this and that's

4577
02:31:36,880 --> 02:31:39,359
beautiful okay

4578
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:40,880
we're ending human supremacy we're

4579
02:31:40,880 --> 02:31:42,319
holding people accountable and we're

4580
02:31:42,319 --> 02:31:43,760
spreading a clear

4581
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:46,880
vegan message on behalf of the animals

4582
02:31:46,880 --> 02:31:49,520
so for me that's what that's one win

4583
02:31:49,520 --> 02:31:50,560
that i would use

4584
02:31:50,560 --> 02:31:52,640
as an indicator for us moving in the

4585
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:53,600
right direction

4586
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:56,000
and i think more and more vegans are

4587
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,520
taking on board this

4588
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:01,200
this need to to

4589
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:04,240
be serious about how we're

4590
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:06,880
being perceived by others and like

4591
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:08,720
taking that seriously and being wanting

4592
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:10,319
wanting to be taken seriously when it

4593
02:32:10,319 --> 02:32:11,760
comes to this

4594
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:15,600
uh i don't even think that many

4595
02:32:15,600 --> 02:32:17,359
others are really even taking that into

4596
02:32:17,359 --> 02:32:19,040
account

4597
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,520
but i think more and more people are

4598
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:22,479
actually

4599
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:24,319
on boarding this attitude which i think

4600
02:32:24,319 --> 02:32:26,000
is another great indicator

4601
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,560
uh i think there are other great

4602
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:30,080
indicators we could point at

4603
02:32:30,080 --> 02:32:33,120
but i guess it depends on the way you

4604
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:33,600
see it

4605
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:35,439
and i guess also whether you're an

4606
02:32:35,439 --> 02:32:37,600
optimist or you're a pessimist

4607
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:42,319
and um and

4608
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:43,840
we don't think that you should just do

4609
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:46,080
one thing anyway like people should do

4610
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,439
what they think is effective and they

4611
02:32:47,439 --> 02:32:48,800
should be as effective as they can

4612
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,560
possibly be doing it

4613
02:32:50,560 --> 02:32:53,439
and uh we need people fighting in

4614
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:54,560
politics

4615
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:56,399
we need people fighting in government we

4616
02:32:56,399 --> 02:32:58,080
need people fighting in corporate we

4617
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:00,000
need people fighting on the streets

4618
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,280
we need people fighting in hollywood

4619
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:05,200
it doesn't stop this fight is is

4620
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:06,960
multi-faceted and it needs to continue

4621
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:09,439
at every level

4622
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:11,680
yeah absolutely i think also something

4623
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:13,200
that's not being considered

4624
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:16,240
is that although some countries uh there

4625
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:17,359
may be reductions

4626
02:33:17,359 --> 02:33:19,760
in how much how much animal products are

4627
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:21,120
being produced right or how many people

4628
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:22,080
are consuming them

4629
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:24,720
or using them um whereas other countries

4630
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:25,520
are on the rise

4631
02:33:25,520 --> 02:33:28,160
like for example unfortunately india is

4632
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:29,200
one of those countries

4633
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:30,720
uh where i know we have a few indians

4634
02:33:30,720 --> 02:33:32,560
here in the chat who can you can also

4635
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:34,319
you know vouch for this that the amount

4636
02:33:34,319 --> 02:33:36,399
of animal products specifically meat

4637
02:33:36,399 --> 02:33:38,160
uh being consumed in india is actually

4638
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:40,240
increasing and there are other countries

4639
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:42,160
uh especially in the east who are having

4640
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:44,000
the same situation previously they had

4641
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,600
very low consumption and

4642
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:47,280
now because of the western influence

4643
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:49,200
they are consuming more whereas it seems

4644
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:49,520
like

4645
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:51,040
some western countries are on the flip

4646
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:52,399
side of that they're consuming less so

4647
02:33:52,399 --> 02:33:53,200
this is

4648
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:56,720
you know without without the hard data

4649
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:59,040
to really show and really dive into

4650
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:00,240
everything that's happening we can't

4651
02:34:00,240 --> 02:34:02,160
just make a general statement that we're

4652
02:34:02,160 --> 02:34:02,960
losing

4653
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:05,040
you know we need to actually look at

4654
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:06,080
which countries are

4655
02:34:06,080 --> 02:34:08,319
having an impact and which aren't and

4656
02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:09,359
why and

4657
02:34:09,359 --> 02:34:12,399
dig deep into each situation right

4658
02:34:12,399 --> 02:34:14,800
um and i agree with everything you said

4659
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:16,000
also about um

4660
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,760
you know getting the message right and

4661
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:19,840
it's reassuring to know that

4662
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:21,760
the more people are starting to be more

4663
02:34:21,760 --> 02:34:23,600
unapologetic i think the word would be

4664
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:26,960
about defending the animals yeah yeah

4665
02:34:26,960 --> 02:34:29,600
and i also want to say that we don't

4666
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:31,520
have definitive numbers either way on

4667
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:31,920
this

4668
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:35,760
on the amount of animals being oppressed

4669
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:38,640
so i am skeptical of whatever data

4670
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:39,040
people

4671
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:41,680
are using to make these assumptions or

4672
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:42,880
to make these

4673
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:45,520
declarations about where things are in

4674
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,200
terms of the numbers

4675
02:34:47,200 --> 02:34:51,040
so i i question that because i remember

4676
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:54,960
when bite size vegan did a video

4677
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:58,160
and she was trying to in that video give

4678
02:34:58,160 --> 02:34:59,040
people

4679
02:34:59,040 --> 02:35:02,240
the kill count and even she concluded in

4680
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:03,120
that video

4681
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:05,120
there's no way to determine this we i

4682
02:35:05,120 --> 02:35:06,479
i'm only

4683
02:35:06,479 --> 02:35:09,840
uh making an educated guess here okay

4684
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:11,920
so even after hours and hours of

4685
02:35:11,920 --> 02:35:13,359
research being put into that video that

4686
02:35:13,359 --> 02:35:14,319
was her conclusion

4687
02:35:14,319 --> 02:35:16,479
but how are these individuals coming to

4688
02:35:16,479 --> 02:35:18,080
this conclusion when

4689
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:21,920
is where is his daughter even being

4690
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:22,880
logged

4691
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:24,960
how all those marine animals that are

4692
02:35:24,960 --> 02:35:26,800
slaughtered in the fish industry are

4693
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:28,240
they being logged

4694
02:35:28,240 --> 02:35:30,640
who's who's noting how many animals are

4695
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,000
being murdered like

4696
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,800
it's all an assumption and um i wouldn't

4697
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:35,200
trust

4698
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:37,840
any any piece of information coming from

4699
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:38,960
animal agriculture

4700
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:42,080
of course or any study that's funded by

4701
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:43,520
animal agriculture of course

4702
02:35:43,520 --> 02:35:45,520
if it says something to the effect that

4703
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:46,960
their products are on the rise and

4704
02:35:46,960 --> 02:35:48,479
they're doing really well and all this i

4705
02:35:48,479 --> 02:35:49,920
wouldn't trust that

4706
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:52,720
and especially since we know actually

4707
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:54,399
that the dairy industry is on its way

4708
02:35:54,399 --> 02:35:54,880
out

4709
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:57,280
there's many indicators of that so it

4710
02:35:57,280 --> 02:35:58,240
depends on

4711
02:35:58,240 --> 02:36:00,319
what you're looking at and i need more

4712
02:36:00,319 --> 02:36:01,840
data and more evidence

4713
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:05,760
to even entertain the notion that uh

4714
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,359
that it's going in the opposite

4715
02:36:07,359 --> 02:36:09,359
direction in terms of the numbers

4716
02:36:09,359 --> 02:36:10,160
however

4717
02:36:10,160 --> 02:36:12,319
in terms of public perception and the

4718
02:36:12,319 --> 02:36:14,080
way that animal rights is perceived

4719
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:16,640
publicly now animal rights has been

4720
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:18,319
pushed even further back than it was

4721
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:20,800
last year i do agree with that

4722
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:24,160
yeah no totally i agree all right that

4723
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:25,760
brings us to the end of my topics

4724
02:36:25,760 --> 02:36:29,359
um and now if you if you i guess it's

4725
02:36:29,359 --> 02:36:30,960
late for you guys actually but if you do

4726
02:36:30,960 --> 02:36:32,720
have another like let's say let's limit

4727
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:33,840
it to maybe like

4728
02:36:33,840 --> 02:36:35,120
i don't know would you agree for another

4729
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:37,200
20 minutes is that okay 30 minutes or is

4730
02:36:37,200 --> 02:36:38,560
that is that too much for you guys right

4731
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:39,359
now

4732
02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:41,840
20 minutes sounds good all right i can

4733
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:44,000
see

4734
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,520

4735
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:47,359

02:36:47,359 --> 02:36:51,200
yeah yeah how late is it sorry what time

02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:53,680
40. all right okay cool yeah we can

4738
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:55,120
start to wrap up then so

4739
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:57,680
um guys you got to put some questions in

4740
02:36:57,680 --> 02:36:58,240
um

4741
02:36:58,240 --> 02:36:59,760
i didn't see you putting any questions

4742
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:01,840
in so far i'm not going to go back

4743
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:02,240
through

4744
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:03,439
all the way back to the beginning

4745
02:37:03,439 --> 02:37:04,399
because i know some of you aren't even

4746
02:37:04,399 --> 02:37:06,080
here anymore so if you've got questions

and if you really really want your

4749
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:10,000
question to be asked like right now and

4750
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,760
you want it to make sure you fit it in

4751
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:13,439
20 minutes in the next 20 minutes then

4752
02:37:13,439 --> 02:37:14,160

do a super chat and that will 100 be

4754

02:37:18,240 --> 02:37:20,640
something shitty um to be to put it

4756
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:21,439
bluntly

4757
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:23,920
uh but yeah we're open to questions now

4758
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:25,200

here i know it's it's mentally

4767
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:43,600
exhausting to go through these things

4768
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:45,760
um especially considering that some of

4769
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:46,880
them are really ugly

4770
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:49,760
accusations right um i've i've the

4771
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:51,200
reason one of the main reasons i wanted

4772
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,640
to do it as well is because i feel like

4773
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:53,280
i can

4774
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,280
empathize with this because i've also

4775
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:56,800
been on the receiving end of equally

4776
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:58,479
ugly accusations so i know

4777
02:37:58,479 --> 02:38:00,319
i know how it feels when you read that

4778
02:38:00,319 --> 02:38:02,560
like we all we all pretend like yeah

4779
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:02,880
well

4780
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:04,880
whatever you know whatever but like

4781
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:05,920
really it does

4782
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:07,439
it does get you right when you read

4783
02:38:07,439 --> 02:38:09,120
something so horrible and someone's

4784
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:10,399
saying it about you

4785
02:38:10,399 --> 02:38:12,399
i know how it feels so i'm happy we

4786
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:14,399
could get through this and and you know

4787
02:38:14,399 --> 02:38:16,880
i hope a few people have had uh i hope

4788
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:18,240
it's given a few people something to

4789
02:38:18,240 --> 02:38:19,760
think about at least so they don't go

4790
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:20,479
and

4791
02:38:20,479 --> 02:38:23,120
repeat this nonsense uh over and over

4792
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:24,160
again because it doesn't

4793
02:38:24,160 --> 02:38:25,600
it doesn't feel good to read it does it

4794
02:38:25,600 --> 02:38:28,000
you know

4795
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,560
yeah i just hope that what people can

4796
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:31,520
take from

4797
02:38:31,520 --> 02:38:34,479
this maybe is that they start thinking a

4798
02:38:34,479 --> 02:38:36,640
bit more critically and if they hear

4799
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:38,960
something they ask for evidence they ask

4800
02:38:38,960 --> 02:38:40,080
for proof

4801
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:43,200
you know they look into it before

4802
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,080
deciding that somebody is a racist

4803
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:47,280
sexist etc

4804
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:49,120
because these are horrible things that

4805
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:50,880
you can say and

4806
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:54,080
yeah i just it's sad that people can

4807
02:38:54,080 --> 02:38:56,880
just use this term so loosely now and

4808
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:57,920
they don't realize

4809
02:38:57,920 --> 02:39:01,520
how insulting and destructive that is

4810
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:03,520
and how much it actually takes away

4811
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:06,800
from the real victims of these

4812
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:10,960
um depression so yeah

4813
02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:14,720
no for sure um

4814
02:39:14,720 --> 02:39:16,000
yeah i'm gonna be honest with you it

4815
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,200
doesn't look like there's any questions

4816
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:18,479
coming in i guess i guess we kind of

4817
02:39:18,479 --> 02:39:19,520
answered so much

4818
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:21,120
i guess they don't have any anything

4819
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:22,319
else that's not being answered to be

4820
02:39:22,319 --> 02:39:24,000
honest i thought about this earlier in

4821
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,680
that we've gone through so many topics

4822
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:27,120
that maybe there aren't going to be

4823
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:28,000
questions

4824
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
because there's like 60 people watching

4825
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:31,359
right now and so far

4826
02:39:31,359 --> 02:39:33,520
there's no questions so if that's the

4827
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:35,120
case we can we can wrap up

4828
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:36,240
there's a lot of statements though i can

4829
02:39:36,240 --> 02:39:38,080
put some of those on the screen you know

4830
02:39:38,080 --> 02:39:39,439
just like for the last like maybe like

4831
02:39:39,439 --> 02:39:41,120
10 minutes or so just

4832
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:42,880
being king saying here they don't have

4833
02:39:42,880 --> 02:39:44,319
evidence for their claims and when they

4834
02:39:44,319 --> 02:39:46,080
do it's hilarious

4835
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:47,920
i i mean this is how it seems to be

4836
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:50,000
right that they there's no evidence or

4837
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:50,800
there is

4838
02:39:50,800 --> 02:39:53,280
evidence but it's not evidence like it's

4839
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,040
something they have made a

4840
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:56,399
i don't know they've made it some kind

4841
02:39:56,399 --> 02:39:58,399
of assumption from or they've twisted

4842
02:39:58,399 --> 02:39:59,200
right

4843
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:01,760
yeah this seems to be happening most of

4844
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:02,399
the time

4845
02:40:02,399 --> 02:40:05,600
really yeah

4846
02:40:05,600 --> 02:40:07,359
that's that's me as well you know that's

4847
02:40:07,359 --> 02:40:09,280
kind of i faced that personally

4848
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:11,920
uh we do have a question though now from

4849
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:12,319
um

4850
02:40:12,319 --> 02:40:13,600
i'm not even going to try and pronounce

4851
02:40:13,600 --> 02:40:14,880
your name i'm sorry i should oh should

4852
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:15,359
not it's

4853
02:40:15,359 --> 02:40:18,240
disrespectful mr jackal let's say um do

4854
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:19,600
you think donating money to animal

4855
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,520
sanctuaries is worth the money

4856
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:22,880
oftentimes the same people who say

4857
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:24,240
outreach doesn't work advocate for

4858
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:25,760
donating to sanctuaries or

4859
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:28,960
fundraise themselves well

4860
02:40:28,960 --> 02:40:30,800
of course it's worth the money i think

4861
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:33,040
we need we need people to donate to

4862
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:35,359
animal sanctuaries and also donate to

4863
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:37,279
organizations like av

4864
02:40:37,279 --> 02:40:38,720
so that we can keep doing what we're

4865
02:40:38,720 --> 02:40:41,120
doing i think it's all needed so

4866
02:40:41,120 --> 02:40:43,760
once we have these animals who are being

4867
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:46,240
rescued obviously they're gonna need

4868
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:48,880
a home so that's where the animal center

4869
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:49,840
is coming and

4870
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:51,520
they can't just operate without the

4871
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:53,279
money so yeah

4872
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:54,880
i think that's obvious that it's worth

4873
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:57,120
the money

4874
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:59,040
yeah i think maybe they're also alluding

4875
02:40:59,040 --> 02:41:00,640
to the idea that a lot of

4876
02:41:00,640 --> 02:41:02,800
these same individuals will say don't

4877
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:03,840
donate to

4878
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:07,279
ed or james or av or or whatever

4879
02:41:07,279 --> 02:41:08,720
donate to a sanctuary because it's

4880
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:10,479
better and you kind of

4881
02:41:10,479 --> 02:41:12,240
give the impression that it's one or the

4882
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:13,600
other you know that there's

4883
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:15,760
people that that's it you can only

4884
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:16,640
choose one

4885
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:18,000
and you know one should get all the

4886
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:19,680
money um

4887
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:22,880
which which is nonsense obviously

4888
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:26,000
yeah um

4889
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,319
all right this is from michael paul and

4890
02:41:28,319 --> 02:41:29,200
assal

4891
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:30,800
you're still young do you think we'll be

4892
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:32,479
living in a majority vegan world in your

4893
02:41:32,479 --> 02:41:34,960
lifetime

4894
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:39,680
i want to say yes so badly i just really

4895
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:40,399
don't know

4896
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:43,359
doesn't feel like in the next 50 years

4897
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:46,880
or so we're going to achieve that

4898
02:41:47,279 --> 02:41:51,040
to be realistic standing

4899
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:54,319
sure i think uh for my side of this i

4900
02:41:54,319 --> 02:41:55,120
think i'm

4901
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:57,920
i agree but i also see it as positive

4902
02:41:57,920 --> 02:41:58,640
that we

4903
02:41:58,640 --> 02:42:01,200
i feel like we lay the foundations for

4904
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:02,080
the future

4905
02:42:02,080 --> 02:42:04,880
generations that will achieve this so

4906
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:06,399
although we won't see it

4907
02:42:06,399 --> 02:42:08,160
be realistic we're not going to see it

4908
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:09,840
but we can do a lot of good work

4909
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:13,520
to help the future people to see it

4910
02:42:13,520 --> 02:42:15,359
yeah it's like two-pack said you know we

4911
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:16,560
may not be the ones

4912
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:19,600
to see that but we will be the ones to

4913
02:42:19,600 --> 02:42:21,200
spark the minds of

4914
02:42:21,200 --> 02:42:23,600
those who will create that world and if

4915
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:26,479
we don't create it ourselves but

4916
02:42:26,479 --> 02:42:29,760
um i think it's more important to just

4917
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:30,640
be focused

4918
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:34,319
on spending our lifetime

4919
02:42:34,319 --> 02:42:36,160
on fighting for a vegan world rather

4920
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:37,840
than

4921
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:41,200
being attached to it coming to fruition

4922
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:43,520
in our lifetime not that this question

4923
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:44,479
suggests that

4924
02:42:44,479 --> 02:42:45,920
it's just wondering whether we think it

4925
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:47,600
will happen or not

4926
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:49,520
i guess i just stopped thinking about it

4927
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:51,520
and caring i guess i just i'm focused on

4928
02:42:51,520 --> 02:42:51,920
what

4929
02:42:51,920 --> 02:42:55,200
i can do day to day and

4930
02:42:55,200 --> 02:42:58,319
uh in our lifetime that's all that we

4931
02:42:58,319 --> 02:43:00,000
can focus on

4932
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:03,680
cool agreed um

4933
02:43:03,680 --> 02:43:06,240
a super question this is a super chat by

4934
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:07,279
the way if anyone was wondering what

4935
02:43:07,279 --> 02:43:08,800
that looks like it looks like this so

4936
02:43:08,800 --> 02:43:09,600
you can put a

4937
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:11,680
price on it and it means that will uh

4938
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:12,960
you'll pay for it it means you'll get

4939
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:14,479
your question answered so

4940
02:43:14,479 --> 02:43:16,319
any updates on future campaigns for next

4941
02:43:16,319 --> 02:43:19,760
year once covid is gone

4942
02:43:20,479 --> 02:43:22,160
we're gonna get back to our world tour

4943
02:43:22,160 --> 02:43:23,920
that we were doing i

4944
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:28,399
just um just started that tour

4945
02:43:28,399 --> 02:43:32,080
did two cities ended it as a result

4946
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:36,000
covered so that tour will continue and

4947
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,200
then we will

4948
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:39,760
pardon me we will do two weeks of truth

this whole thing's over awesome cool

4959
02:44:06,880 --> 02:44:08,720
um i've got another question here but

4960
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:10,080
i'll just give you a heads up

4961
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:12,880
it's a it's a it's a one of the it's

4962
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:13,359
another

4963
02:44:13,359 --> 02:44:15,120
kind of accusational question all right

4964
02:44:15,120 --> 02:44:16,880
so just gotta give you a heads up on it

4965
02:44:16,880 --> 02:44:18,399
it's one that i forgot to cover with you

4966
02:44:18,399 --> 02:44:19,439
actually well i didn't have time to

4967
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:20,240
cover it with you but

4968
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:22,640
i think i was gonna cover it but i guess

4969
02:44:22,640 --> 02:44:24,000
we can cover it now

4970
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,800
it's the about the rumor that uh about

4971
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:27,359
the whole

4972
02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:29,760
creation of av um this rumor has been

4973
02:44:29,760 --> 02:44:31,840
around for a long time as far as i know

4974
02:44:31,840 --> 02:44:33,520
i think i've seen you deal with it once

4975
02:44:33,520 --> 02:44:34,800
before on another

4976
02:44:34,800 --> 02:44:37,439
live or something but uh yeah if you

4977
02:44:37,439 --> 02:44:38,000
could

4978
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,680
respond to this is it true that another

4979
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:41,920
activist from melbourne created the idea

4980
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:44,240
i've never this is actually new i've

4981
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:45,680
never had this one

4982
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:48,800
okay okay ask paul to be a violent

4983
02:44:48,800 --> 02:44:52,240
volunteer for them yeah one have you

4984
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:53,520
well

4985
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:55,359
there's a second half of it by the way

4986
02:44:55,359 --> 02:44:56,880
this is this as well this is the second

4987
02:44:56,880 --> 02:45:01,840
half of that question

4988
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:06,240
so there you go what's that yeah this is

4989
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:07,680
a completely new thing i've never heard

4990
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:10,880
of what a wise imagination

4991
02:45:10,880 --> 02:45:15,359
um yeah that's it's interesting because

4992
02:45:15,359 --> 02:45:18,399
uh nah this is i've never heard this one

4993
02:45:18,399 --> 02:45:20,240
before i'm wondering where this has come

4994
02:45:20,240 --> 02:45:21,200
from

4995
02:45:21,200 --> 02:45:24,000
and i'm wondering

4996
02:45:24,800 --> 02:45:27,439
yeah i don't what's the what's the

4997
02:45:27,439 --> 02:45:29,520
correct political what's the political

4998
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:32,080
correct term for chinese whispers these

4999
02:45:32,080 --> 02:45:32,800
days

5000
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:36,000
oh god i don't even know i i would just

5001
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,359
say that but yeah you're right i think

5002
02:45:37,359 --> 02:45:38,880
people would get would get upset about

5003
02:45:38,880 --> 02:45:39,920
that actually no

5004
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:43,680
um i don't know okay well

5005
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:45,279
that's what this is i'm trying to use

5006
02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:46,800
the correct term but uh

5007
02:45:46,800 --> 02:45:49,840
trying not to crucify me guys uh yeah so

5008
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:52,800
you know i don't really know you know i

5009
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:54,319
don't really know

5010
02:45:54,319 --> 02:45:56,479
what this is but we know about the

5011
02:45:56,479 --> 02:45:58,560
original accusation that came

5012
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:02,560
from individuals plural in melbourne

5013
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:05,600
and uh and

5014
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:07,439
that's all documented actually it came

5015
02:46:07,439 --> 02:46:09,120
out with the whole liberation is

5016
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:11,120
inclusive truth of cube

5017
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:14,399
uh video that was made about us

5018
02:46:14,399 --> 02:46:18,640
um they jumped on that bandwagon

5019
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:20,560
and contribute contributed to the

5020
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:22,399
document that was

5021
02:46:22,399 --> 02:46:24,960
linked in the caption of that video

5022
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:27,279
wherever it's shared you'll see the link

5023
02:46:27,279 --> 02:46:29,120
and wherever you see that link you'll

5024
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:31,200
see the document and in that document

5025
02:46:31,200 --> 02:46:32,960
you'll see these individuals who came

5026
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:34,319
out initially

5027
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:37,200
and made this accusation that they

5028
02:46:37,200 --> 02:46:39,120
created av with us

5029
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:42,080
and that we stole it from them now this

5030
02:46:42,080 --> 02:46:43,200
story

5031
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:46,319
that we're being asked of here is

5032
02:46:46,319 --> 02:46:50,399
is is is claiming that it was uh

5033
02:46:50,399 --> 02:46:53,840
we were volunteering

5034
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:05,120
according to this person just to close

5035
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:06,640
this off they say it's they're saying

5036
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:08,000
this is a direct claim

5037
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,319
from the person who claims to have had

5038
02:47:10,319 --> 02:47:12,319
this conversation with you

5039
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:15,359
so it's it's uh it seems like it's um i

5040
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:16,640
don't know if you don't if you don't

5041
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:17,760
know this and it's

5042
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:20,640
it's you know it seems made up i guess

5043
02:47:20,640 --> 02:47:20,960
yeah

5044
02:47:20,960 --> 02:47:25,120
if it's like when someone becomes famous

5045
02:47:25,120 --> 02:47:26,720
many people start coming out and

5046
02:47:26,720 --> 02:47:28,399
claiming that that person is their

5047
02:47:28,399 --> 02:47:29,920
cousin

5048
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:33,279
right uh and yet that's what

5049
02:47:33,279 --> 02:47:34,800
it's kind of like the same thing here

5050
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:36,399
people are claiming that they created a

5051
02:47:36,399 --> 02:47:38,160
v but there's no basis for any of this

5052
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:38,800
we've heard

5053
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:40,800
i've heard a couple of different uh

5054
02:47:40,800 --> 02:47:42,479
people trying to claim this

5055
02:47:42,479 --> 02:47:45,680
over the years but um

5056
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:49,600
these people aren't doing much

5057
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:52,319
yeah so that's what they claim to to

5058
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:53,279
activism is

5059
02:47:53,279 --> 02:47:56,319
but i uh i i feel for these people if

5060
02:47:56,319 --> 02:47:58,000
they really want to tear

5061
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
like they want to try to steal that from

5062
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:01,520
us

5063
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:03,279
all the hard work we've put in and all

5064
02:48:03,279 --> 02:48:05,359
the

5065
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:07,359
commitment we've given to this

5066
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:08,720
organization if they want to try to

5067
02:48:08,720 --> 02:48:09,920
steal that from us

5068
02:48:09,920 --> 02:48:12,000
it says something about what they're

5069
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:13,600
suffering from internally

5070
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:15,760
like i'm sorry that they thought they

5071
02:48:15,760 --> 02:48:17,040
need to take from us

5072
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:19,920
in that scenario because it means that

5073
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:21,040
they must be hurting

5074
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:23,200
somewhere somewhere else and not feeling

5075
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:24,640
adequate for themselves

5076
02:48:24,640 --> 02:48:26,479
and i i really mean it that i feel bad

5077
02:48:26,479 --> 02:48:29,040
for these people

5078
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:32,080
fair enough um funny question okay it's

5079
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:32,800
kind of funny

5080
02:48:32,800 --> 02:48:34,160
um are you friends with joey carver

5081
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:36,000
strong again nope

5082
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:39,040
no yeah i thought that might be the case

5083
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:40,880
i genuinely like i didn't say this in my

5084
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:42,560
video actually but um when i made the

5085
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:44,560
video about this but i on a personal

5086
02:48:44,560 --> 02:48:45,840
note you don't have to respond to this

5087
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:46,160
but

5088
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:48,720
i do hope i do hold some hope that that

5089
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:50,000
can be

5090
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:51,840
fixed between you guys that you can come

5091
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:53,120
to some kind of i don't know

5092
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:54,399
i hope that you can be friends again

5093
02:48:54,399 --> 02:48:55,680
because it was you know you had a good

5094
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:57,200
thing going

5095
02:48:57,200 --> 02:48:58,640
you were supporting each other it was

5096
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:00,399
good it's a shame to see it all go to

5097
02:49:00,399 --> 02:49:01,040
[ __ ]

5098
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:04,160
but he did what he did and what happened

5099
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:06,640
happened you know

5100
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:09,359
yeah look i forgive him for making a

5101
02:49:09,359 --> 02:49:11,040
stupid mistake he's human

5102
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:14,160
humans make stupid mistakes but for as

5103
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:15,680
long as he

5104
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:18,479
won't acknowledge his mistake there's no

5105
02:49:18,479 --> 02:49:18,960
room for

5106
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:20,240
i don't i can't be friends with people

5107
02:49:20,240 --> 02:49:22,080
who lack accountability it's just not a

5108
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:22,640
part of

5109
02:49:22,640 --> 02:49:25,040
my quality that i hold myself to and

5110
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:28,319
what i expect from friends

5111
02:49:28,319 --> 02:49:31,200
yeah that's understandable it's

5112
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:32,880
understandable but i can't yeah as many

5113
02:49:32,880 --> 02:49:34,479
most people i can't help hoping that it

5114
02:49:34,479 --> 02:49:35,600
can be worked out

5115
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:37,600
but it's this is kind of in his court

5116
02:49:37,600 --> 02:49:40,479
isn't it the balls in his court on this

5117
02:49:40,479 --> 02:49:42,560
um someone's asking a question that it's

5118
02:49:42,560 --> 02:49:44,080
it's an obvious question

5119
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:45,600
uh but i'm gonna put it up anyway

5120
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:48,000
because it's a yeah you can easily just

5121
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,279
answer it um

5122
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:50,560
it's on the transgender topic again

5123
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:52,560
they're saying you said everyone should

5124
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:54,000
be respected we all agreed everyone

5125
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,240
should be respected does this mean that

5126
02:49:56,240 --> 02:49:57,760
if someone hates transgender people

5127
02:49:57,760 --> 02:49:59,200
should they be respected

5128
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:01,439
this is what i mean this is what i mean

5129
02:50:01,439 --> 02:50:02,640
about nuance

5130
02:50:02,640 --> 02:50:05,520
uh like if hitler shows up to the cube

5131
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:06,720
should he be respected

5132
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:10,240
like if he just is resurrected from from

5133
02:50:10,240 --> 02:50:11,200
the earth

5134
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:12,880
uh comes back to life and shows up to

5135
02:50:12,880 --> 02:50:14,880
keep will he be respected

5136
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:17,760
uh uh do i have to answer that well we

5137
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:18,160
said

5138
02:50:18,160 --> 02:50:21,200
everyone should be respected we said we

5139
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:22,720
meant the person

5140
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:26,479
who chooses a different pronoun or name

5141
02:50:26,479 --> 02:50:28,800
as well as the person who might disagree

5142
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:30,800
with that ideology

5143
02:50:30,800 --> 02:50:32,640
oppressed that's what we meant we didn't

5144
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:34,399
say the bully

5145
02:50:34,399 --> 02:50:37,680
or the oppressor so oppression is not

5146
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:38,800
respected

5147
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:41,520
i thought that like because we led into

5148
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:42,640
that point

5149
02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:46,000
with saying that actually and

5150
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,359
so yeah no totally totally i i

5151
02:50:49,359 --> 02:50:51,200
understand this is i think i watched a

5152
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:51,840
uh

5153
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:53,600
this thing with uh bilbao you know the

5154
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:55,040
comedian bilbao

5155
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:56,960
he he he was talking about new ones as

5156
02:50:56,960 --> 02:50:58,319
well do you know the ginger guy

5157
02:50:58,319 --> 02:50:59,840
and speaks really quickly i don't know

5158
02:50:59,840 --> 02:51:00,960
if you know what i'm talking about yeah

5159
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:01,359
cool

5160
02:51:01,359 --> 02:51:03,200
so he he talked about nuance as well and

5161
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:04,720
he was saying that like

5162
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:07,439
everything i say is twisted and he said

5163
02:51:07,439 --> 02:51:08,240
something like

5164
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:09,680
he said he was talking about consent

5165
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:11,760
right and i'm gonna by the way

5166
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:13,040
for anyone that's looking for something

5167
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:14,880
to get me on here this is bill burr's

5168
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:16,720
words not my words all right don't

5169
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:19,040
[ __ ] start here um but basically he

5170
02:51:19,040 --> 02:51:19,600
said

5171
02:51:19,600 --> 02:51:21,359
like today's world like how how do you

5172
02:51:21,359 --> 02:51:23,040
even work right so he said like it's all

5173
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:24,160
about consent and there's

5174
02:51:24,160 --> 02:51:25,840
you're at risk all the way always and he

5175
02:51:25,840 --> 02:51:27,200
said how do you

5176
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,120
have it rough now like if a girl wants

5177
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:30,720
it rough how do you do that

5178
02:51:30,720 --> 02:51:33,200
because you know how does it work right

5179
02:51:33,200 --> 02:51:34,800
and this guy in the crowd shouted

5180
02:51:34,800 --> 02:51:37,359
you need to get consent first and he was

5181
02:51:37,359 --> 02:51:38,160
like

5182
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:40,479
this is why you can't make jokes anymore

5183
02:51:40,479 --> 02:51:42,399
he was like this [ __ ] [ __ ]

5184
02:51:42,399 --> 02:51:44,720
thinks that i'm saying that i was not

5185
02:51:44,720 --> 02:51:46,720
going to get consent i never said that

5186
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:48,240
he was like when did i say that why

5187
02:51:48,240 --> 02:51:49,520
would you assume that that's what i

5188
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:49,840
meant

5189
02:51:49,840 --> 02:51:51,840
right and he was like it's [ __ ]

5190
02:51:51,840 --> 02:51:53,760
ridiculous you assumed the worst of me

5191
02:51:53,760 --> 02:51:55,200
and he called this guy an idiot and a

5192
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:57,040
[ __ ] and like really slammed him

5193
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:58,720
for shouting that because it's like i'm

5194
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:00,720
not a monster dude like i'm making a

5195
02:52:00,720 --> 02:52:01,600
joke about

5196
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:03,279
rough sex i'm not making a joke about

5197
02:52:03,279 --> 02:52:05,359
not getting consent are you insane

5198
02:52:05,359 --> 02:52:06,800
there's a very big difference and this

5199
02:52:06,800 --> 02:52:08,880
is i'm saying it because he commented on

5200
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:10,080
it and it's kind of what's just happened

5201
02:52:10,080 --> 02:52:11,600
here it's like you guys said respect

5202
02:52:11,600 --> 02:52:13,840
everyone and someone understood that as

5203
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:14,640
respect

5204
02:52:14,640 --> 02:52:16,960
transphobic people it's like no that's

5205
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:17,680
not what i

5206
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:21,120
said no one said that jesus do you think

5207
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:22,720
i would have let that fly

5208
02:52:22,720 --> 02:52:24,319
in the conversation do you really think

5209
02:52:24,319 --> 02:52:25,840
i am that morally

5210
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:27,359
corrupt that i would just let someone

5211
02:52:27,359 --> 02:52:28,960
say that on my channel and just not

5212
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:30,319
question wait a minute you've just said

5213
02:52:30,319 --> 02:52:31,680
you want to respect transphobes it's

5214
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:32,479
like no

5215
02:52:32,479 --> 02:52:34,640
i would never let that go even if i had

5216
02:52:34,640 --> 02:52:36,800
someone like some monster on the channel

5217
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:38,880
i would never let that go but that's not

5218
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:40,560
the case you know

5219
02:52:40,560 --> 02:52:41,760
anyway i'm just i've just got off the

5220
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:43,200
handle a bit there but we're at the end

5221
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:45,920
anyway it's fine

5222
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:49,600
it's just as silly as having to say

5223
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:52,720
oh with the exception of intersex

5224
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:54,479
when you're saying there's two sexes

5225
02:52:54,479 --> 02:52:56,319
like why should we even have to say that

5226
02:52:56,319 --> 02:52:58,080
it's an anomaly of course that's an

5227
02:52:58,080 --> 02:52:59,520
exception to the rule

5228
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:03,279
and like you know

5229
02:53:03,279 --> 02:53:04,880
you don't need to say certain things i

5230
02:53:04,880 --> 02:53:06,479
guess if you are

5231
02:53:06,479 --> 02:53:09,439
reading between the lines and you are uh

5232
02:53:09,439 --> 02:53:10,000
attuned

5233
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,720
to nuance and you don't just see things

5234
02:53:12,720 --> 02:53:13,600
through

5235
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:16,880
this uh cancel culture lens where

5236
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:19,040
you know is it what what billboard said

5237
02:53:19,040 --> 02:53:21,439
is these days you say something and what

5238
02:53:21,439 --> 02:53:23,200
you say goes into someone's brain and

5239
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:24,720
then it gets cut

5240
02:53:24,720 --> 02:53:26,720
with all of the things that they're

5241
02:53:26,720 --> 02:53:28,560
conditioned with

5242
02:53:28,560 --> 02:53:31,120
and you know and then it comes out of

5243
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:33,359
their brain they spit it out after that

5244
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:34,960
you know according to what they perceive

5245
02:53:34,960 --> 02:53:36,399
it to be and it's usually completely

5246
02:53:36,399 --> 02:53:37,359
different to what

5247
02:53:37,359 --> 02:53:42,000
you said and uh it's the same thing here

5248
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,200
it shouldn't that shouldn't that's

5249
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:44,640
something that shouldn't in my opinion

5250
02:53:44,640 --> 02:53:46,080
shouldn't need to be clarified you

5251
02:53:46,080 --> 02:53:47,840
should assume the best in people not the

5252
02:53:47,840 --> 02:53:48,800
worst

5253
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:51,279
i i don't understand what you what you

5254
02:53:51,279 --> 02:53:52,960
have done or even what i have done

5255
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:54,240
because i'm involved in this that

5256
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:55,840
question was for all of us right because

5257
02:53:55,840 --> 02:53:56,240
i

5258
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:58,720
they're assuming that you have said that

5259
02:53:58,720 --> 02:53:59,840
and i have

5260
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:02,160
i have been like yeah great cool like

5261
02:54:02,160 --> 02:54:03,760
what did i do to deserve that what did

5262
02:54:03,760 --> 02:54:05,680
you do to deserve that assumption like i

5263
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:06,720
i don't think any of us has done

5264
02:54:06,720 --> 02:54:08,720
anything particularly you know that

5265
02:54:08,720 --> 02:54:10,800
horrible to think that any of us would

5266
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:12,800
like believe that or let it go it's such

5267
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:13,920
a strange

5268
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:15,439
and i think the person's saying it

5269
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:16,640
innocently enough i don't think they're

5270
02:54:16,640 --> 02:54:17,359
trying to attack

5271
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:19,680
but at the same time it's like dude be

5272
02:54:19,680 --> 02:54:21,359
reasonable here come on

5273
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:24,800
it's a fair enough question um but

5274
02:54:24,800 --> 02:54:26,800
i mean i i don't know is it fair enough

5275
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:28,640
actually am i trying to be nice

5276
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:29,920
i don't think it's fair enough at all in

5277
02:54:29,920 --> 02:54:31,600
my opinion i think it's something that

5278
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:33,359
if you watched the whole conversation

5279
02:54:33,359 --> 02:54:34,160
and listened

5280
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:36,319
without assuming the worst in all three

5281
02:54:36,319 --> 02:54:38,160
of us you would come to the conclusion

5282
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:39,359
that that that's not

5283
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:41,439
what was being said like that you're not

5284
02:54:41,439 --> 02:54:42,720
going to respect a bigger you're not

5285
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:44,560
going to respect someone who hates trans

5286
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:45,920
people like

5287
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:47,760
what the [ __ ] like what kind of rational

5288
02:54:47,760 --> 02:54:49,200
person would ever

5289
02:54:49,200 --> 02:54:51,439
have irrational hatred or acceptance of

5290
02:54:51,439 --> 02:54:52,640
irrational hatred

5291
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:54,960
like it's not it's not rational to

5292
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:55,920
accept that

5293
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:58,000
and we've i don't believe we've been

5294
02:54:58,000 --> 02:54:59,840
acting irrationally in this conversation

5295
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:00,240
so i

5296
02:55:00,240 --> 02:55:02,479
just i guess what i'm trying to say is

5297
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:04,240
like assume

5298
02:55:04,240 --> 02:55:06,240
good intentions stop assuming bad

5299
02:55:06,240 --> 02:55:07,680
intentions of people

5300
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:09,840
um whoever you're talking to really like

5301
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:11,439
give them a chance to prove themselves

5302
02:55:11,439 --> 02:55:12,240
to be

5303
02:55:12,240 --> 02:55:14,960
you know good don't don't look for bad

5304
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:16,800
look for good and assume they want

5305
02:55:16,800 --> 02:55:18,560
the best i think is it's really

5306
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:20,399
important we'll have one more question

5307
02:55:20,399 --> 02:55:22,160
and then we'll close off it's it's a

5308
02:55:22,160 --> 02:55:25,600
it's a nice question i think um do the

5309
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:27,760
where's the money go people have any

5310
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:28,960
idea how much

5311
02:55:28,960 --> 02:55:31,120
unpaid work that you guys have put into

5312
02:55:31,120 --> 02:55:32,080
animal rights

5313
02:55:32,080 --> 02:55:35,120
do you think thank you generally

5314
02:55:35,120 --> 02:55:38,399
that's a refreshing perspective

5315
02:55:38,399 --> 02:55:41,520
to hear and not just for our case

5316
02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:44,560
and uh it's not just refreshing for

5317
02:55:44,560 --> 02:55:47,680
for us to hear for you know when i think

5318
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:49,439
about us and that and the criticisms

5319
02:55:49,439 --> 02:55:50,399
that we get

5320
02:55:50,399 --> 02:55:52,319
it's also refreshing to hear that any

5321
02:55:52,319 --> 02:55:53,680
other

5322
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:55,920
activist on behalf of any other activist

5323
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:59,439
that gets similar criticisms like this

5324
02:55:59,439 --> 02:56:00,560
you know i don't think that animal

5325
02:56:00,560 --> 02:56:03,040
rights activists

5326
02:56:03,040 --> 02:56:06,720
are um getting

5327
02:56:06,720 --> 02:56:10,479
the opportunity given to them all the

5328
02:56:10,479 --> 02:56:12,960
respects given to them that they deserve

5329
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:17,520
in terms of acquiring financial security

5330
02:56:17,520 --> 02:56:18,720
whilst

5331
02:56:18,720 --> 02:56:20,399
being an animal rights activist

5332
02:56:20,399 --> 02:56:23,040
full-time

5333
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:27,200
if there's any question about motives

5334
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:31,359
then you just have to look at

5335
02:56:31,359 --> 02:56:33,520
you know like this person has graciously

5336
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:34,800
pointed out and i think i think it's

5337
02:56:34,800 --> 02:56:36,080
refreshing because it's

5338
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:38,560
it's the kind of perspective that really

5339
02:56:38,560 --> 02:56:39,520
people should have

5340
02:56:39,520 --> 02:56:42,160
is looking more deeply at the work that

5341
02:56:42,160 --> 02:56:42,960
people do

5342
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:45,760
and that doesn't lie and if it is a

5343
02:56:45,760 --> 02:56:47,439
question about motives

5344
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:49,520
then yeah look at all the work we've

5345
02:56:49,520 --> 02:56:51,439
done when we had no money towards any of

5346
02:56:51,439 --> 02:56:52,960
this and we put all of our own personal

5347
02:56:52,960 --> 02:56:54,080
money towards everything

5348
02:56:54,080 --> 02:56:58,399
it's when we went broke

5349
02:56:58,399 --> 02:57:00,160
putting all of our money into a b from

5350
02:57:00,160 --> 02:57:01,920
the beginning and we will continue to do

5351
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:03,359
that

5352
02:57:03,359 --> 02:57:06,560
to the very end for the for the simple

5353
02:57:06,560 --> 02:57:07,120
fact

5354
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:09,279
that it's about the mission it's about

5355
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:10,240
what

5356
02:57:10,240 --> 02:57:14,560
the organization is intended for and uh

5357
02:57:14,560 --> 02:57:16,960
well you know that's the thing i yeah i

5358
02:57:16,960 --> 02:57:17,600
don't know

5359
02:57:17,600 --> 02:57:19,600
what else to say about this i guess you

5360
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:21,279
want to answer that

5361
02:57:21,279 --> 02:57:24,080
yes i just want animal rights activists

5362
02:57:24,080 --> 02:57:24,960
to feel

5363
02:57:24,960 --> 02:57:27,200
that it's a very viable option for them

5364
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:28,560
to come into animal rights as an

5365
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:30,800
activist to be an activist full-time

5366
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:34,000
part-time and to have financial security

5367
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,560
and not to

5368
02:57:37,120 --> 02:57:40,240
expect that they're going to

5369
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:45,279
be walking on on hot coal

5370
02:57:45,279 --> 02:57:48,800
just because they they do want financial

5371
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:50,160
security while being

5372
02:57:50,160 --> 02:57:52,000
by you know while being an animal rights

5373
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,240
activists i know that we

5374
02:57:54,240 --> 02:57:57,040
probably entertain on this stream and

5375
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:58,000
probably entertain

5376
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,640
the accusations maybe too much i don't

5377
02:58:00,640 --> 02:58:01,439
know i'll walk

5378
02:58:01,439 --> 02:58:05,760
back and i'll judge later but uh

5379
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:06,960
that's why i think it's important to

5380
02:58:06,960 --> 02:58:08,960
just know that you know

5381
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:11,520
we need to hold a certain priesthood and

5382
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:13,359
set a certain tone for animal rights

5383
02:58:13,359 --> 02:58:14,080
activists

5384
02:58:14,080 --> 02:58:16,399
in this movement who may be wanting to

5385
02:58:16,399 --> 02:58:18,080
come into this movie maybe they want to

5386
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:19,680
come into this movement and become an

5387
02:58:19,680 --> 02:58:20,240
activist

5388
02:58:20,240 --> 02:58:22,000
or maybe they're maybe you're already an

5389
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,600
activist and

5390
02:58:23,600 --> 02:58:26,319
you know i want them to understand that

5391
02:58:26,319 --> 02:58:27,840
there's nothing wrong

5392
02:58:27,840 --> 02:58:30,080
with fighting for the animals whilst

5393
02:58:30,080 --> 02:58:31,760
also acquiring financial security as

5394
02:58:31,760 --> 02:58:34,479
long as your motive is not financial

5395
02:58:34,479 --> 02:58:38,240
to begin with yeah

5396
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:40,800
absolutely and we'll wrap it up there

5397
02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:42,960
i'll just say that um

5398
02:58:42,960 --> 02:58:44,560
i hope that you said we gave too much

5399
02:58:44,560 --> 02:58:46,160
attention to some of these topics and i

5400
02:58:46,160 --> 02:58:49,439
would be you know likely to agree but um

5401
02:58:49,439 --> 02:58:51,840
tended to agree but i think what i was

5402
02:58:51,840 --> 02:58:53,279
trying to achieve here is to have this

5403
02:58:53,279 --> 02:58:53,760
be

5404
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:55,040
in my opinion like the last the last

5405
02:58:55,040 --> 02:58:56,560
time i'm gonna talk about any of this

5406
02:58:56,560 --> 02:58:58,319
anyway and i hope the last time you also

5407
02:58:58,319 --> 02:58:59,120
talk about it

5408
02:58:59,120 --> 02:59:00,160
because this is going to go up on my

5409
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:01,920
channel now and it's going to have

5410
02:59:01,920 --> 02:59:02,560
sectors

5411
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:04,640
marked for every single topic so that

5412
02:59:04,640 --> 02:59:06,160
any time anything does come up about

5413
02:59:06,160 --> 02:59:06,720
this

5414
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,640
and and you know someone's saying asking

5415
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:10,080
you hey what do i say to this

5416
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:11,680
you can literally say to them go and

5417
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:13,359
find you know the topic that they're

5418
02:59:13,359 --> 02:59:14,000
talking about

5419
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:15,600
copy paste and if they don't want to

5420
02:59:15,600 --> 02:59:18,000
watch the video well [ __ ] them then

5421
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:19,200
you know like they they want to keep

5422
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:20,479
making their quesations fine but if they

5423
02:59:20,479 --> 02:59:21,439
want to know the truth well we've

5424
02:59:21,439 --> 02:59:22,640
answered it it's right here

5425
02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:24,160
that was the goal for this so you're

5426
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:25,600
right we did give it too much attention

5427
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:27,439
but that's because this was the goal

5428
02:59:27,439 --> 02:59:29,760
i don't think most of these accusations

5429
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:30,960
deserved even

5430
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:34,399
five seconds of time but i i do

5431
02:59:34,399 --> 02:59:36,240
i do i do think it's important to have

5432
02:59:36,240 --> 02:59:38,479
it somewhere so that it's dealt with

5433
02:59:38,479 --> 02:59:40,000
for good you know in my opinion and

5434
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:41,200
that's kind of what i wanted to achieve

5435
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:43,040
today and i hope we've achieved that

5436
02:59:43,040 --> 02:59:45,279
um thank you both for coming here and

5437
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:46,800
doing this you didn't have to do it and

5438
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:48,720
i think people overlook that as well you

5439
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:50,319
you you don't owe anyone anything

5440
02:59:50,319 --> 02:59:51,680
and you did not have to sit here and

5441
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:53,279
answer these questions and they weren't

5442
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:54,640
nice questions they were shitty

5443
02:59:54,640 --> 02:59:55,359
questions

5444
02:59:55,359 --> 02:59:57,200
um i know what it feels like to be

5445
02:59:57,200 --> 02:59:58,640
attacked i know what it feels like to be

5446
02:59:58,640 --> 02:59:59,520
called these things

5447
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:01,279
and i know how horrible it feels when

5448
03:00:01,279 --> 03:00:03,680
people ask me more questions about it so

5449
03:00:03,680 --> 03:00:05,200
i do understand what you've just been

5450
03:00:05,200 --> 03:00:06,399
through and i do understand that this

5451
03:00:06,399 --> 03:00:07,600
was a shitty thing to do

5452
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:09,040
and i really do appreciate you coming

5453
03:00:09,040 --> 03:00:11,040
and doing it and i'm sure i'm sure there

5454
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:11,920
are other people

5455
03:00:11,920 --> 03:00:13,520
who have people have already been saying

5456
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:14,720
in the chat you can check later that

5457
03:00:14,720 --> 03:00:16,319
they also really appreciate you coming

5458
03:00:16,319 --> 03:00:17,279
doing this and

5459
03:00:17,279 --> 03:00:20,080
and they support you and um one person

5460
03:00:20,080 --> 03:00:20,800
even said

5461
03:00:20,800 --> 03:00:23,600
they originally didn't support you but

5462
03:00:23,600 --> 03:00:24,160
after

5463
03:00:24,160 --> 03:00:25,760
seeing some of your videos they were

5464
03:00:25,760 --> 03:00:27,920
like okay no i actually really hope that

5465
03:00:27,920 --> 03:00:29,439
they can work this out so

5466
03:00:29,439 --> 03:00:31,920
you know this is people i feel like

5467
03:00:31,920 --> 03:00:32,640
people want

5468
03:00:32,640 --> 03:00:34,800
to support and i hope this can bring

5469
03:00:34,800 --> 03:00:36,319
some of that support back for people who

5470
03:00:36,319 --> 03:00:36,960
have maybe

5471
03:00:36,960 --> 03:00:38,640
got lost or confused along the way

it's important i think as a

5479
03:00:52,399 --> 03:00:54,240
member of the animal rights movement to

5480
03:00:54,240 --> 03:00:55,760
want to clarify these things

5481
03:00:55,760 --> 03:00:58,160
it's not really about us again it's

5482
03:00:58,160 --> 03:00:59,040
about the tone

5483
03:00:59,040 --> 03:01:00,560
it's about the precedent we set for

5484
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:03,760
others in this movement

5485
03:01:04,080 --> 03:01:08,399

03:01:59,439 --> 03:02:01,040
and also of course don't expect that

5516
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:02,399
this video will make a difference some

5517
03:02:02,399 --> 03:02:03,760
people don't want to understand some

5518
03:02:03,760 --> 03:02:05,840
people aren't interested in av anymore

5519
03:02:05,840 --> 03:02:07,200
and they just they're just done

5520
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:09,120
that's totally fine don't get upset if

5521
03:02:09,120 --> 03:02:11,120
it happens just just you do you and let

5522
03:02:11,120 --> 03:02:12,399
them do them and

5523
03:02:12,399 --> 03:02:14,160
and that's it you know don't don't take

5524
03:02:14,160 --> 03:02:15,439
it personally

5525
03:02:15,439 --> 03:02:17,439
yeah i would say it's the same with

5526
03:02:17,439 --> 03:02:19,439
non-vegans who

5527
03:02:19,439 --> 03:02:21,520
many non-vegans aren't reachable aren't

5528
03:02:21,520 --> 03:02:22,800
willing

5529
03:02:22,800 --> 03:02:24,640
and there's no point in continuing to

5530
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:26,399
outreach those individuals either

5531
03:02:26,399 --> 03:02:30,319
it's the same thing with vegans yep sure

5532
03:02:30,319 --> 03:02:32,000
all right cool we'll end it there thanks

5533
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,479

5534
03:02:34,479 --> 03:02:36,800
