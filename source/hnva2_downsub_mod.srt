all right so now i'm going to move on

56

to the next thing great all right so

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,319
yeah we're in lockdown here in australia

58
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,159
and currently

59
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,360
we can only assemble 10 people max

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
in a public area and so given that

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,040
restriction

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,319
it's going to be really difficult for

63
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,480
any cubes to happen i'm going to be

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,040
doing

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,799
a limited attendance cube in melbourne

66
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
tomorrow

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
we'll see how we go with that but

68
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,879
yeah because of the restrictions around

69
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,439
the world we only have

70
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,280
170 odd

71
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,120
almost up to 200 i think i haven't

72
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,879
even checked the figures

73
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,159
over the last couple of days but

74
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,799
yeah i had a look at the figures

75
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,439
last

76
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,000
and was impressed that we have almost

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,799
200

78
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
events scheduled given the restrictions

79
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,760
that we have so

80
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
yeah last year we had 500 cubes

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
scheduled around the world and as you

82
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,360
may or may not know international cube

83
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
day is the biggest day of the year for

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,280
us

85
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,840
because it's our biggest campaign and

86
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,240
the essence of it in case you don't know

87
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
is to do as many cubes around the world

88
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,440
as possible

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,639
so it's a fantastic time of the year for

90
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,160
us but given the restrictions

91
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,120
it's a limited

92
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
campaign

93
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,120
all right what's up vegan king all right

94
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,199
so let's get into this we're gonna

95
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,080
start off oh i need to send out a quick

96
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,000

i've got no one moderating this stream

100
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,440
i'm going to be doing it myself

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,320

102
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,000

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,479

111
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,600
huge help

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,000

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,240
ah yeah cool no worries if someone wants

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
to moderate though it won't take much

115
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,080
work i just want to

116
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
i just don't want to be dealing with

117
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,759
trolls and shit but it's no big deal

118
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,280
even if they do come up

119
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,039
you know if they want to come on and try

120
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,680
to wreck my stream

121
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,759
they're welcome all right so let's do this

122
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840

126
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,759
is

127
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,800

is review it for you live

131
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
and the first thing i need to do here

132
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,199
is since i haven't done this in a while

133
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,680
i need to

134
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,319

140
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,919
begin with

141
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,080
let me know if you have any and

142
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,160

144
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,639

in the comments

146
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
damn

147
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,639
struggleville

148
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,360
trying to get

149
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:58,240
this video to download properly

150
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,000
"please do more of these streams paul

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
it's good to interact with you"

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:13,759
well i would like to do more streams

153
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,160
all right

154
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:26,400
why is it doing that

155
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,919
yeah so again if you have any questions

156
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,120
let me know in the comments and i'll go

157
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,479
ahead and answer them for you

158
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,680
now here's a question what's your

159
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,599
opinion on wild animal suffering it's a

160
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,679
topic i recently discovered i don't know

161
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
if you've heard of it or not

162
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,479
might have seen it

163
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:40,799
from

164
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,440
humane hancock okay so i did respond to

165
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,640
this

166
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,399
uh on my instagram so i forget what i

167
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,440
said exactly

168
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,720
but i said something like

169
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,600
let's just focus i mean my answer to

170
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,640
this question is pretty straightforward

171
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
let's just focus on the human inflicted

172
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
suffering on animals that we

173
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,800
are currently i mean it's the biggest

174
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,480
issue

175
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,600
that we have to be accountable for so

176
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,160
we need to look in the mirror before we

177
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
start trying to intervene further

178
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,120
in the animal kingdom

179
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,640
can we just stop murdering animals first can we stop

180
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
enslaving torturing and murdering them

181
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
that's what i would like to address

182
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
this whole thing and i think this is what

183
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
i said in my instagram post

184
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,360
this whole thing is such an

185
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,399
odd discussion to me it's so strange

186
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
and it reminds me of how

187
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,680
off-base it is for human beings to

188
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,200
explore and discover

189
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
the universe and space

190
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,760
to the extent that humans do and yet we

191
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,000
still have 80 percent of the ocean

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
80 percent completely

193
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,240
undiscovered unobserved unexamined

194
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,200
you know this is just very typical of

195
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,040
humans i think

196
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,959
that we don't address we don't look into

197
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,920
everything that's right here before us

198
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,880
it starts with us

199
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,720
and then here on this planet

200
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,480
we want to try to find a home on mars and yet

201
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,839
we don't even know how to get things right

202
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,160
here

203
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,000
it makes no sense

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,279
so that's my answer to that

205
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,560
all right so next question

206
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
all right so

207
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,959
long day yeah cool that sounds good

208
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,360
laura

209
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,920
both three hour cubes you're doing two

210
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
for international cube day

211
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
awesome

212
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,600
cool a question here about whether

213
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
it has started or not

214
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
we are about to get started

215
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
i'm taking some questions

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,240
just to get this started and then we're

217
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,440
going to

218
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:15,839
get into the meat of this

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,480
uh much love silvia thank you for the support

220
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,160
and thank you for representing us

221
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,600
how to talk to a parent

222
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,040
how to talk to a parent to turn them

223
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,640
vegan if he or she

224
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
doesn't want to hear about animal suffering

225
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,959
anytime i try to talk about

226
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,760
he/she walks

227
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,440
out of the room and hangs up the phone

228
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,120
etc

229
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,120
agatha's question regarding parents

230
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:48,640
it's no different to

231
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
talking to anybody else

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,240
you hold human beings accountable for

233
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,000
the evils they commit against

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,279
non-human animals whether they're family

235
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:57,920
or friends

236
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,639
doesn't matter because they're guilty

237
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,040
just the same as anybody else

238
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,480
the thing with family is

239
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
you obviously have more of an affinity with family

240
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
and that means that

241
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,920
you should give them more patience

242
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,120
more effort

243
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,959
more of an explanation more not an

244
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,320
explanation it's just

245
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,680
more time

246
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,839
more time but at a certain point

247
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
you have to say to yourself

248
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,639
i have done my best

249
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,760
and they aren't open and willing to end

250
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,120
their human supremacy

251
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,480
and i know it's a hard road to walk

252
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,279
but it's the truth and i have dedicated

253
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,639
myself to truth on this

254
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,600
planet i want my life to be dedicated to

255
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
that and nothing else so

256
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
so that comes first i'm a human being

257
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,959
dedicated to truth before i am

258
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,399
a human being that belongs to a family

259
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,000
does that make sense?

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,480
i also do think that family could be

261
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,320
one of the biggest downfalls of society

262
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,839
but i'm not going to get into that

263
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,000
all right so moving on another question here

264
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,839
about overpopulation

265
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,120
i'm just going to quickly answer this

266
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,639
but this is going to be the last

267
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,720
question i answer before we get started

268
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,279
and i want to

269
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,600
thank you for your patience guys

270
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,279
all right so the next question here is

271
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,839
when we've solved the overpopulation of

272
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,639
pet animal issue

273
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,720
do you think that we can still

274
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,200
have companion animals but create a

275
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,160
solution

276
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,000
when none die in shelters yeah

277
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,399
absolutely like sanctuaries

278
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,000
all of these shelters should be turned

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,240
into sanctuaries

280
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,839
instead of a kill business

281
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,839
all right i'm going to get started now

282
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,519
guys thanks for your patience so

283
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,839
i'm going to share my screen

284
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,600
i'm going to need your feedback in the comments so

285
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,560

287
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:17,839
video and the audio

288
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:31,839

okay i'm gonna have to this "is ten years

290
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,000
ago but the temperament of the times

291

right now

292
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,519
from what i can see is that most people

293
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
already get" sorry about that guys

294
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,000
i didn't realize

295
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,680

296
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
okay so i'm gonna have to unplug this

mic when i'm playing

298
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,839
and then plug it back in when i need to

299
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,160
make commentary

300
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,600
technical nonsense but it is what it is

i'm gonna start playing right now

310
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,600
okay thanks, my name is paul bashir

311
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,440
i am the co-founder and director of

312
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,600
anonymous for the voiceless

313
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,800
i became an animal rights activist in

314
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,199
june of 2015 and i started av with my

315
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,160
partner who i met basically just before

316
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
we started av

317
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,079
asal and we started av in april of 2016.

318
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,759
since then we've become one of the most

319
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,440
prominent animal rights organizations

320
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,399
in the world not that it's a goal of

321
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,000
ours necessarily at the moment to have a

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,759
billion chapters

323
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,240
that was our goal but we've changed that

324
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,360
now to

325
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,400
wanting to have chapters who are working

326
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,839
with us

327
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,439
working in alignment with what we're

328
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,039
trying to achieve and what we

329
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,119
set out to achieve when we started av

330
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,359
this workshop is an attempt to do that

331
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,319
with regards to

332
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,400
outreach as you all know at the cube of

333
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,039
truth we have protocols we have rules

334
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,280
and we have structure and we find that

335
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,039
really important because the more

336
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,679
serious we take our roles on the streets

337
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,360
or in general the more serious people

338
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
take us and the message

339
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,520
as you know we have rules like wearing

340
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
all black at the cubes

341
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,520
we wear the masks and only one kind of

342
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,360
mask in the cube we form a

343
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,320
square cube structure

344
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,160
there's the outreach team and the cube team

345
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,679
so we have these kinds of structures

346
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,120
another thing that we have as a

347
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
standardized structure is the outreach

348
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,000
and that's what i'm going to be talking

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
to you about today

350
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
and the standard outreach approach that

351
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,080
we expect at the cubes

352
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,559
is there to help you and help everybody

353
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,600
that does outreach

354
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
to be effective and the only thing i've

355
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
found to be fulfilling in this line of

356
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,160
work

357
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,960
is effective activism

358
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
it's the only thing that will help you

359
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,559
to process the frustration and the anger

360
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,080
that you will naturally have if you're

361
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,200
paying attention

362
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,760
as you may know you've seen some

363
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,520
outreach from me

364
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,360
but it's from the earlier stages and

365
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,600
only recently did i start putting

366
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,720
outreach content up online last year

367
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,360
there was a gap where i wasn't putting

368
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,039
outreach content up online and that's

369
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,640
because i was

370
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
being patient and i was applying

371
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
different approaches

372
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
and i wanted to see what stuck what didn't

373
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
i'm teaching you nuts and bolts

374
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,360
stuff here that i've observed i've

375
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,200
learned i've applied and i

376
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,240
have observed others apply and i can

377
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,799
deem

378
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,200
confidently now works effectively for

379
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,799
everybody this is also

380
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,120
an approach that is truly for everybody

381
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,880
but i'm going to start from the very top here

382
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,080
with the definition of veganism because

383
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
in our movement right now

384
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,240
veganism is confused like everybody has

385
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
a different definition, have you noticed this?

386
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,080
does this bother you guys? yeah

387
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,240
don't you wish we're on the same page about this?

388
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,280
wouldn't it be easier? i don't know why

389
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,039
we're so confused about it it seems

390
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,559
pretty straightforward but i'll get into

391
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,480
the definition of veganism for you

392
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
it's a way of living that seeks to

393
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,600
exclude

394
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,559
any form of animal exploitation as much

395
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,559
as practicably possible

396
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,039
in the definition it doesn't include

397
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,039
anything to do with the environment

398
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:31,919
it doesn't include

399
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,320
anything to do with human health

400
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,919
it's purely about

401
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,720
animals and their rights and it really

402
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,240
is that simple

403
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,480
another thing i'd like to tell you and

404
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,880
this has helped me to understand

405
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,000
the function of an activist is to be a

406
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,640
medium

407
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,679
of truth because truth exists in this world

408
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,280
but it doesn't act on its own so we need

409
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,919
to act

410
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,160
and we need to speak the truth we need

411
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,440
to continually

412
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,400
speak the truth and we need to act on it

413
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,320
as much as possible

414
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,080
so that's your role as an activist and

415
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,559
it really is that simple

416
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,679
but if you ever get lost and you

417
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,360
are ever in doubt just remember you're

418
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,720
speaking for the animals in the same way

419
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
you would want to be spoken for if

420
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
you're in their position

421
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,440
telling people the truth shouldn't be

422
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,000
perceived by you as something that will

423
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,039
start a fight

424
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,799
because if you perceive it that way

425
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,559
maybe others will pick up on that

426
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,840
but if you just think that you're

427
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,360
telling people the truth because that's

428
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,280
the loving thing to do

429
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
then people will pick up on that as well

430
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,200
and they respect truth

431
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,520
people respect people who tell them the truth

432
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,880
have you ever heard the expression

433
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,799
that you don't lie to your friends?

434
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,400
you shouldn't lie to your friends

435
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,480
well if you extend that

436
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
to the public isn't that what being

437
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,559
compassionate is

438
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,600
so people conflate veganism

439
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
with compassionate living a lot of the

440
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,360
times as well

441
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
i don't think not stabbing animals to

442
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,880
death is necessarily

443
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
compassionate, i just think that's the

444
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,120
same and rational thing to do

445
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,600
but people also claim that this approach

446
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,960
is not compassionate that we're not

447
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,360
being compassionate to the abusers

448
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,440
not giving them a chance

449
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,240
but that's nonsense because i'm a street activist

450
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,799
that's all i do is educate people i give

451
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,480
people a chance to wake up to this like i was

452
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,039
i'm not forcing people to go vegan

453
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,799
that's physically impossible to do

454
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,600
if that was possible i'd probably

455
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,520
be doing it right now but you can't do that

456
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,159
so you have to focus on just talking to

457
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,400
people and hoping they wake up

458
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
and that is the most compassionate thing

459
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,760
that you can do is offer people

460
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,200
education

461
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
but again telling people the truth is

462
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,520
truly the most loving thing that you can do

463
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,880
i don't know why we think it's hateful

464
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
people say "you're shaming people"

465
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,120
we're not necessarily shaming people

466
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,600
we are making people feel guilty though

467
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,880
because how else are we going to make

468
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,400
people go vegan if they don't feel guilty?

469
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,280
isn't that why you went vegan?

470
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,039
because you felt incredibly guilty for what you were contributing to?

471
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,880
well why would we avoid

472
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,760
having others feel that?

473
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,440
why would we try to avoid that?

474
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,280
why would we dance around the topic and

475
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
compromise on the message and panda

476
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,840
when that's the goal is for them to feel guilty?

477
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,280
this is the real form of compassion that

478
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,120
i see that we need to bring into this

479
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,480
movement more

480
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,760
is telling non-vegans the truth

481
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,880
and one thing that

482
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
will happen when you're talking to

483
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,520
non-vegans is you're going to notice a

484
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,440
lot of conscious and some unconscious

485
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,159
distractions that come out so whether

486
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,440
they're consciously and maliciously

487
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
doing that or not

488
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,960
you have to be aware of the fact that

489
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,480
they're going to distract

490
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,960
away from what needs to be discussed

491
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,679
because

492
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
their guilt is going to be flaring when

493
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
you're talking about something that's

494
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,480
obviously wrong. everybody knows that

495
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,640
animal abuse is wrong

496
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,080
that's the other thing is that we think

497
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,640
as vegans that people don't already know

498
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,520
about this

499
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,360
people walk over to a cube instantly

500
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,679
know that we're vegan instantly know

501
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,120
that we're trying to promote an animal

502
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,440
rights message. it may not have been the

503
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,360
case 10 years ago but the temperament of

504
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,520
the times right now

505
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,440
from what i can see is that most people

506
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,640
already get the fact

507
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,080
that we're talking about animal rights,

508
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,000
we're talking about veganism, and they

509
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,840
need to go vegan. that's the crux of the

510
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,280
conversation that they're going to have with us

511
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,360
so don't act like non-vegans don't know this

512
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,080
okay? they already know, we're a lot more

513
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,280
obvious about this than we think we are.

514
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,880
when we have these very simple

515
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,320
conversations with people

516
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
their guilt will flare up and they start

517
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
creating distractions that they don't

518
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,520
even believe in.

519
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,480
like plants have feelings. they're trying to

520
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,240
distract from them taking accountability

521
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,600
from themselves, taking accountability

522
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,919
for what they're doing.

523
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,840
it's your role again as a medium of

524
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,400
truth to anchor the conversation back,

525
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,240
to make sure that that individual is in

526
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,600
the hot seat.

527
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,240
and it's not just something that they

528
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
can just palm off

529
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,960
and the distractions that they're

530
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,600
creating you have to

531
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,840
break through them, that's your job as an

532
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,200
activist is to break through them and

533
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,279
not let the distractions become

534
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,159
real distractions for what needs to be discussed

535
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,200
you've all heard non-vegan excuses, i'm sure.

536
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,200
a lot of people think when i do an

537
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,039
outreach workshop i'm going to get into

538
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,039
how to deal with excuses, how to deal

539
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,480
with certain arguments; i'm not actually

540
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,200
going to do that.

541
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,960
if you have questions during the Q and A though

542
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,880
i'll answer them for you.

543
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,640
but i'm not going to do that because

544
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,159
i've come to know that

545
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,520
they're all just ridiculous excuses

546
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,919
and there is no excuse under the sun

547
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,120
that should ever trump you

548
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,960
plants have feelings if people really

549
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,480
believe that plants have feelings.

550
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,240
how come we don't have a single group out there

551
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,640
that protest against lawn mowing?

552
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
how come when the australian bushfires

553
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,200
occurred, we didn't hear anything about

554
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
the plants burning to death?

555
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
we only heard about the wildlife and

556
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,960
when they said wild life

557
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,200
they were talking about animals every

558
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,559
single time

559
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,440
even people like joe rogan who's a

560
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,840
fucking avid hunter and loves to justify

561
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,600
not being vegan at every opportunity he gets,

562
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,240
even he said he supported the wildlife

563
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,000
in australia and he was referring

564
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,200
to the koalas and the other animals.

565
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,840
people around the world have only shown

566
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,679
empathy or sympathy

567
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,840
towards the animals that were suffering

568
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,360
in the wildfires, right?

569
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
that just goes to show that this is very

570
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,520
obvious in people's minds,

571
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,880
and that's why i'm saying this is a lot

572
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,919
more obvious than we think it is.

573
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,159
it really is people already care about

574
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,520
animal rights,

575
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,360
and the reason i know that is because

576
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,559
nobody

577
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,360
unless they're a psychopath would be

578
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,080
comfortable

579
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,000
with the label of being an animal abuser.

580
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,559
and that's what non-vegans are.

581
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,320
they're abusing animals.

582
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,000
the only reason why they feel

583
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,600
comfortable is because the guilt is

584
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,960
shared by everybody.

585
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,039
we've broken out of that now, we can see

586
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,799
straight now,

587
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,760
but it doesn't mean that it's not

588
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
completely obvious still for everybody

589
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,520
else, we've just taken action

590
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,440
on this. none of these excuses

591
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,120
are ever going to trump you, they should

592
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
never have you feeling flustered,

593
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,240
they should never have you feeling like

594
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,080
you don't know the answer, because the

595
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,159
answer is always very simple and it's

596
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,159
the fact that they can't justify abusing

597
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,919
animals needlessly.

598
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,159
end of story. whenever in doubt just

599
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,360
compare to any other injustice.

600
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,279
but it should injustice like a delicacy

601
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,799
and something that we eat

602
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,440
maybe once a week instead of i don't

603
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,400
think that the

604
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
the rate that we use is natural

605
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,400
we're at the extreme end of

606
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,840
this lifestyle now.

607
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,600
Would you say that with any other

608
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,320
injustice? like sexism?

609
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,440
child abuse? no, but i'm saying, would you

610
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
take that position? would you say

611
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
that it would be too extreme to avoid at

612
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,000
all? that we should still

613
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,799
do it sometimes?

614
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,080
yeah that was good, that was a good rebuttal!

615
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,240
we're not vegan, but we're vegetarian

616
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,279
with lil chicken

617
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,559
yeah so we're fish-chicken vegetarian. so, would you

618
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,559
take the same position with any other

619
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,679
injustice? let's say

620
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,080
we're talking about sexism or racism.

621
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,760
would you have the same

622
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,159
view on that? where are we going here?

623
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,200
so let's say we're talking about racism.

624
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,760
would you be like "i'm against racism,

625
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,520
i don't want to be a racist,

626
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,720
but then maybe like on sundays i make an exception."

627
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,159
to be racist? yeah! so this is a form of

628
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,600
discrimination against another species.

629
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,279
while you're still having a little bit

630
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,279
of egg or chicken,

631
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,159
whatever i'm not sure what you're having,

632
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,240
you're still really supporting animal

633
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
cruelty and more exploitation.

634
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,640
we will do it slowly. i understand it

635
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,679
might seem like a big

636
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,640
jump; would you take that on any other

637
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,000
issue? for example if somebody said "i'm

638
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,279
going to slowly

639
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,240
stop beating my child", "i'm going to

640
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,120
slowly become

641
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,159
a non-racist". no. you wouldn't be uh?

642
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,960
that's we got to do it right?

643
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,919
do you think that we should

644
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,440
contribute this to last or do you think

645
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,480
that we should say: "hey we should just

646
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
stop hurting animals"?

647
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
stop. stop, right? people will

648
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,919
talk a good game about reducing or

649
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,320
making excuses for why they won't go

650
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,279
vegan

651
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,279
just compare to any other injustice in

652
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,279
that moment we are an animal rights

653
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,880
organization, we've never deemed

654
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,080
ourselves to be an

655
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,679
environmentalist group, a group of

656
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:47,840
environmentalists

657
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,039
trying to change the world for the

658
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,480
betterment of the environment. we've

659
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,080
never claimed to be

660
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,399
a nutritionist organization, a group of

661
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,679
nutritionists trying to change the world

662
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,360
for the betterment of human health.

663
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
We've only ever claimed to be an animal

664
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,559
rights organization.

665
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,399
But there's this myth that exists in the

666
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,240
vegan movement; that when you promote

667
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,640
health and environment these things will

668
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,399
get people more interested in animal rights.

669
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,480
And that's the reason why we've been

670
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,159
talking about these things: is to try to

671
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,360
get them hooked.

672
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,919
If someone doesn't seemingly care about animals,

673
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
well i guess i'll talk to them about

674
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,200
health, because they have heart disease. i

675
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,399
guess i'll talk to them about how they

676
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,679
can reverse their heart disease by

677
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,799
eating a plant-based diet.

678
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,320
If they don't seemingly care about the animals,

679
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,240
we think we'll talk to them

680
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,000
about the environment. this is destroying

681
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,919
the rainforest, this is destroying it,

682
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,799
climate crisis ... the idea that this

683
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,960
will lead someone to animal rights

684
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,559
and caring about animal rights is a

685
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,640
complete myth. animal rights is obvious.

686
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,760
Nobody in their right mind would be

687
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,679
comfortable with the label of being an

688
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,600
animal abuser.

689
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,679
So it's not a matter of people not caring

690
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:54,799
about animal rights,

691
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,640
it's a matter of you not promoting

692
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,760
animal rights correctly.

693
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,520
It may seem like a tough pill to swallow

694
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
to hear that,

695
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,440
but i'm only telling you this because

696
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,640
it's the truth.

697
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,679
And it's what i've learned to be true.

698
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,720
People avoid animal rights and make you

699
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,080
think they don't care about animal rights

700
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,279
for a reason. It's a distraction, like i

701
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,960
said: they create distractions

702
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,720
they don't want to face something that's

703
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,200
obviously wrong.

704
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,520
And then you bind into that by then

705
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,679
pandering to environment and health.

706
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,480
People don't seemingly care about animals because

707
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,159
the way that we advocate

708
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,960
veganism, to people, doesn't care about

709
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,080
animals.

710
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,880
It seems like in this movement the more

711
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
i hear people advocating for veganism,

712
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,200
the less i hear animal rights being tied

713
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,159
into it.

714
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,080
They quickly get mentioned and then we

715
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,360
move on to

716
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,720
how this is really bad for the

717
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,080
environment and really bad for your

718
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,600
health.

719
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,919
So that's why people don't care about

720
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,279
animal rights.

721
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,360
The vegan movement hasn't been promoting

722
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,720
animal rights.

723
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,320
I also just want to say this: those who

724
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,960
say that what i'm doing is aggressive;

725
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,600
that this isn't compassionate. Well, the

726
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,159
irony the way i see it is the irony

727
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,240
is that: when people aren't advocating

728
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,679
for the animals,

729
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:12,960
in the way that they communicate directly,

730
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,919
then you're actually putting the compassion

731
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,799
you want to receive from the abuser

732
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,640
before the compassion you're supposed to

733
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,240
be extending to the victim.

734
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,039
I think that's hypocrisy, right?

735
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,440
If we truly are compassionate beings,

736
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,120
then we need to extend compassion to the

737
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,799
victims, and when we're talking to the abuser

738
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,279
like i've already explained, it is

739
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,519
actually the truest form of compassion

740
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,320
to offer the abuser education.

741
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,080
What do we usually do with abusers?

742
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,120
We put them in prison, don't we? right

743
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,159
If these beings

744
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,760
were any other species

745
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,000
other than a non-human (so if they were human),

746
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,320
these people would be put in prison,

747
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,679
wouldn't they? There would be no

748
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,360
conversation on the streets,

749
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,159
no trying to convince people, so this is compassion.

750
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
This is the most compassionate thing we

751
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,399
can possibly do; is try to

752
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,159
wake people up with our words. But if we

753
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,399
pander and we move away from animal

754
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,399
rights when we're talking to people,

755
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,919
then we're only doing more of an

756
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,840
injustice, more of a disservice to the animals.

757
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,159
It's not about how people feel about

758
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,480
animals: do you have a dog at home?

759
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,679
do you have a cat at home?

760
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,240
A lot of the times we, as vegans, try to lean

761
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,919
on the compassion that we think they

762
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,919
already have for animals, for non-human animals.

763
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,039
We use dogs as examples a lot in this movement,

764
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,320
we try to say:

765
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,919
would you do this to your dog?

766
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,679
how would you feel if your dog was eaten?

767
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,360
what about if a dog was getting beaten

768
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,720
up right in front of us right now,

769
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,240
would you act on it?

770
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,799
That blows up in our face a lot of the time

771
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,440
Replace all those cows with dogs

772
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,480
just for a moment in your mind

773
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,919
dogs don't produce milk?

774
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:58,960
yes they do, yeah, they do but

775
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,159
not like ahh ...  it's hard to ..

776
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,600
i don't ... i try

777
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,720
just morally, i make that

778
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,799
comment just for you to consider it morally

779
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,600
What is the difference between puppies

780
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,159
being raised, all the female puppies

781
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:25,440
to get milk out of them, instead of cows?

782
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,679
I don't feel difference.

783
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,590
You don't feel any difference?

784
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,519
Why do we think we live in a society

785
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,000
that cares about dogs?

786
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,399
Why do we think that? I don't understand

787
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,080
why our movement thinks

788
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,159
that we live in a society full of dog lovers.

789
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,480
If we truly love dogs, would we have shelters?

790
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,960
that kill dogs by the thousand? every day?

791
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,519
around the world? Clearly if we lived in

792
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,440
a society of dog lovers just the same

793
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,799
way that we

794
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,399
love human children then we'd have

795
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,600
people protesting at the front of

796
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,120
shelters all the time.

797
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,039
But that's not happening. If you said

798
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,480
that stuff to me, it wouldn't really work

799
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,240
(because i was never really a dog lover growing up).

800
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,240
But my point is to say

801
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,399
that this isn't an animal conversation,

802
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,480
this is an accountability conversation.

803
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,839
If you were talking to me about the

804
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,679
blood on my hands, if you're talking to

805
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,760
me about the harm i'm causing to beings

806
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,280
who suffer like i suffer,

807
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,800
it doesn't matter about how i feel about animals,

808
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,440
it matters, but how i feel about

809
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,000
causing suffering. I also need to make

810
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,760
this clear: a lot of people out there

811
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,199
think that morality is

812
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,760
subjective. When it comes to this,

813
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,800
morality is

814
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,280
as objective as it gets: it's as black

815
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,399
and white as my t-shirt.

816
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,079
When it comes to animal rights people

817
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,000
will love for you to think that there's

818
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,839
a great area, that there's something that

819
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:42,960
you're not considering, you're not

820
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,040
open-minded enough. What about

821
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,199
if you're on a deserted island? Or those

822
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,159
who don't have,

823
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,399
you know, access to ... they always try to

824
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,560
bring up grey areas to this, to see

825
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,480
where the morality can slip.

826
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
It doesn't ever slip. You're never going

827
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,079
to wake up one day and think animal abuse

828
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,599
is justified, are you? You're not gonna go

829
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,960
back on your morals,

830
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,560
if you understand that this is wrong.

831
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
You're not gonna go back on child abuse.

832
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,599
You're not gonna wake up one day and

833
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,920
think child abuse is okay. i think today

834
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,440
i'm comfortable with this idea i'm gonna

835
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
do it today. it's black and white,

836
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,560
it's always wrong and it's never justified.

837
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,520
Another thing that vegans will focus way

838
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,200
too much on, when advocating for animal rights,

839
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,800
is being liked by the other person.

840
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,599
We think that being likable vegans

841
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,920
is going to get people to take veganism seriously.

842
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,960
Raise your hand if you've fallen into

843
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
this trap, i know i have.

844
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,079
Thank you for being honest,

845
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,160
because we don't want to be the preachy vegan,

846
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,839
we don't want to be the pushy vegan,

847
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,520
we don't want to be the annoying vegan,

848
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,119
we don't want to be the vegan that turns people off.

849
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,960
Veganism, here's the thing: non-vegans

850
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,160
have been trying to bully us

851
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,320
psychologically into this thinking,

852
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,760
and you need to realize that and you know better.

853
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,160
This is just manipulation

854
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,040
People are trying to make you

855
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,400
feel insecure about this,

856
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
because they're shooting down the messenger.

857
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,119
Because they don't want to take the message seriously

858
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,640
and face it. When we play into this,

859
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,200
they win. When i say they, the abusers.

860
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,880
And the animals lose.

861
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,000
It's a flaw

862
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,280
to care about being liked,

863
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,599
more than what you're saying and the

864
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,119
rights of these animals, the rights of these beings.

865
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,680
In no other situation do we actually use

866
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,880
this line of thinking,

867
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,040
so we're actually being hypocrites here.

868
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,480
You probably noticed that people

869
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,079
actually like people who don't really care

870
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,480
what other people think of them.

871
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,079
When you don't care what other people think of you.

872
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,920
And to the contrary when you care

873
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,280
so much about what other people think of you,

874
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,160
people actually don't like that.

875
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,079
They don't like that about you,

876
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,200
because it comes off as a weakness

877
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,280
and i actually think that telling people

878
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,040
the truth is the best way to achieve this anyway.

879
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760
So it's counterproductive: if you want to be liked

880
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,240
then do things that are deserving of being liked.

881
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,000
And this shouldn't be your goal,

882
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,440
being liked shouldn't be your goal because

883
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,119
if somebody likes you and goes vegan for that reason

884
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,080
what happens when they don't like you anymore?

885
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,160
Which will happen!

886
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Imagine civil rights activists focusing

887
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
on being liked by white people

888
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,320
in order for them to take black rights seriously.

889
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,520
How weird would that be? Trying to be

890
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,119
accommodating in whichever way socially

891
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,400
to have them taking

892
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
black rights seriously: it would be

893
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,960
insane to even witness that happening.

894
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,000
And this is also a tool that you should

895
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,920
use in your advocacy

896
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,240
to make sure that you're in line with

897
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,760
what you're supposed to be doing here as

898
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,000
an activist. If you ever feel like

899
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,079
questioning what you're doing, compare it

900
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,760
to any other injustice.

901
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,680
Would you be advocating this way in any

902
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,920
other case for any other injustice?

903
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,880
If not, don't do it here! Animals deserve

904
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,720
way better from us.

905
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,839
When we first started AV

906
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
i noticed that the outreach that we were

907
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,480
doing on the streets ..

908
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,079
i noticed that there was a lot of things

909
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,320
that i learned in my previous

910
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,839
work experience in doing sales ..

911
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:21,440
all the sales training that i had received ..

912
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,359
there were things in that that i could

913
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,720
carry over into outreach, that were applicable here.

914
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,680
And so if you go on our website it says

915
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,920
we use a value-based sales approach.

916
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
I want to explain what that means because

917
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,359
i think there's been

918
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,240
a bit of a confusion about this.

919
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,359
I definitely don't mean the kind of sales that

920
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,320
we're commonly used to

921
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,480
and that we commonly know.

922
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,960
I'm talking about certain aspects of

923
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,720
sales that are applicable here because

924
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,000
at the end of the day what we're doing

925
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,359
is trying to convince somebody of

926
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,800
something they're not already convinced on.

927
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,720
And that's what sales is really.

928
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,119
I'm trying to convince you right now

929
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,640
to apply this approach when you're doing outreach,

930
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,560
and that's why i brought this into this equation.

931
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,079
But i want to explain that i really do not mean

932
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,000
schmoozing people, and telling people

933
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,480
what you think they want to hear,

934
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,880
and using hooks like psychological hooks

935
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,240
to trick them into

936
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,920
signing on the dotted line.

937
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,599
That's not how this works at all.

938
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,960
Activism is a different ballpark to sales.

939
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,720
One of the traditional things that occurs in sales

940
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,640
is the three-step process,

941
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,160
for any sale, so i'll talk you through that right now.

942
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,599
The three-step process is really simple

943
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,320
the first step is ... all right

944
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,640
okay i'm gonna pause right here because

945
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,400
this is the part where i find

946
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,640
that there's the most confusion and

947
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,000
it's the whole sales message.

948
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,920
So yes i'm going to break down this

949
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,280
three-step process,

950
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,520
but the only reason i'm doing that here

951
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,119
is to show you

952
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,480
where sales tools (and really they're not

953
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,160
sales tools, they're communication tools)

954
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,000
but where these communication tools are

955
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,400
applicable from the sales world

956
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,800
into activism. But again i need to

957
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,520
reiterate this, i said this in the video:

958
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,880
sales is not activism. Just because you

959
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,040
have x number of sales,

960
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,800
years of sales experience, doesn't mean

961
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,240
you have x number

962
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,119
of years experience in activism.

963
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,160
That's not how this works at all:

964
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,560
it just means that you've learned

965
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,760
a few things about communication that might,

966
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,599
might, be applicable here in activism.

967
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,680
I found in fact when i go over all of the

968
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,440
sales things i've ever learned, that most of it

969
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,079
is actually unapplicable, unequivocally unapplicable.

970
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,000
And that's because the goal in sales

971
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
is usually to get someone to sign on the

972
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,520
dotted line, and there's usually a

973
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,920
financial incentive.

974
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,400
Here i named it the

975
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,640
value-based sales approach from the very

976
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,079
beginning in 2016, when we started AV, for

977
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,760
the purpose of

978
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,760
setting it apart from sales.

979
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,720
In general, the common view of sales.

980
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,440
this is a new

981
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
i was trying to create something new

982
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,880
here, where we can

983
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,040
carry over what is applicable. And what

984
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,560
i've found the deeper i've gone into

985
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
this is, that a very minimal amount

986
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,319
is actually applicable from the sales

987
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,960
world, over here.

988
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,640
So with that added commentary on this bit,

989
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,079
i will now continue for you guys ... to get

990
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,160
somebody convicted in what it is that

991
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,480
you're trying to convince them of.

992
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,520
we have all of the lodge process up to sales

993
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,040
One of the traditional things that

994
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,960
occurs in sales is the three-step

995
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,040
process, for any sale.

996
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,359
So i'll talk you through that right now.

997
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,520
The three-step process

998
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,800
is really simple: the first step is to get

999
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,880
somebody convicted in what it is that

1000
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,200
you're trying to convince them of.

1001
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,800
We have all the logic, all of the reason

1002
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,200
on our side, and it's important to use

1003
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,920
logic and reason (i'm not saying don't use that),

1004
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,280
but if you don't get somebody

1005
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,440
emotionally convicted in this

1006
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,079
issue, because it's a justice issue,

1007
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,920
then don't expect a shift from anybody.

1008
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,839
That's why i don't like these

1009
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,599
philosophical discussions that we have

1010
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,760
with people about veganism. We have these

1011
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,079
what seems to be like a bar discussion,

1012
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,160
just food for thought,

1013
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,200
and that's a real issue

1014
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,839
because that's not what this is supposed

1015
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,520
to be about. This is an accountability conversation

1016
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,560
and that first step is best achieved

1017
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,319
when you connect them to the sense of injustice

1018
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,079
and you hold them accountable to that injustice.

1019
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,720
The second step is to make sure that

1020
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,000
they understand that they,

1021
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,119
as an individual, are responsible.

1022
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,359
That they're in the hot seat

1023
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:58,880
This isn't something they can just palm

1024
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,040
off to the government, or palm off to

1025
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,400
these industries and say "we need to

1026
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
focus on petitioning against these industries".

1027
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,240
This is about them as an individual and

1028
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,680
you can't let them get out of that,

1029
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,359
that's your job.

1030
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,920
Meat doesn't just harm yourself,

1031
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,520
it harms someone else.

1032
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,440
Someone or something?

1033
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,280
Do you think an animal is a thing?

1034
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,280
Oh okay, i'll see where you're going but

1035
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,720
like let's ..

1036
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,079
but that's the problem, that's going to

1037
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,040
be your that's going to be the club

1038
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,960
the lack of compassion for non-human um

1039
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,240
you know, that's going to be your problem

1040
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,160
But what about you? because i'm talking

1041
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,040
to you right now.

1042
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,319
Do you have a lack of compassion for

1043
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,240
non-human animals? No I don't

1044
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,319
So are you against animal exploitation?

1045
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,839
Yes I am okay. So what do you think you

1046
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,480
can do about it?

1047
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,440
Yeah we're talking .. yeah i will share

1048
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,760
this conversation with my family.

1049
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,079
What do you think you will do though?

1050
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,880
yeah i will start

1051
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,119
more

1052
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,119
The third step, once you have achieved

1053
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,560
that second step

1054
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,960
(through dealing with their objections,

1055
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,599
anchoring it back to accountability ..

1056
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,280
once they concede you move on to the

1057
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,680
third step) is tying in the benefits.

1058
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,280
Everybody loves to know what's in it for

1059
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,760
them, right? Because humans are selfish,

1060
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,119
right? okay so

1061
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,040
the number one benefit for you going

1062
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,440
vegan: obviously for the animals it's

1063
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
that they no longer have to be tortured

1064
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,720
and abused by you. But the benefit for you

1065
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,640
is that you no longer have to abuse them,

1066
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,920
and therefore you're no longer a hypocrite.

1067
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,920
Because you say that you're against

1068
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,000
animal abuse, in fact in that very conversation

1069
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,359
they said that, that they're against animal abuse.

1070
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,000
Right? that's the only reason we're vegan

1071
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,440
today. Why you guys are sitting here

1072
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
right now, trying to learn about outreach?

1073
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,280
It's because you hate the hypocrisy, don't you?

1074
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,800
You would never want to live with that

1075
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,000
hypocrisy again, would you?

1076
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,119
more importantly would never want to abuse animals anymore

1077
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,920
would you? I used to say "if you

1078
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,520
do this correctly you eat a whole foods

1079
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,200
plant-based diet, you will actually get

1080
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,280
the health benefits from doing this" as well

1081
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,040
and i used to say that "it's better for

1082
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,720
the environment if you do this:

1083
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,960
as a benefit, you have a lower footprint".

1084
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
It's a mistake

1085
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,280
because i'm conflating animal rights

1086
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,960
with environmentalism

1087
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,839
and with human health.

1088
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,280
I know that it's going to be tempting

1089
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,079
for you to do this, even after this workshop.

1090
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,160
You're going to be very tempted to go there still

1091
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,480
You only know whether this is true

1092
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,960
if you apply this,

1093
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,480
but if i can save you some time it's a mistake.

1094
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,920
Focus on why, as opposed to how. Way more

1095
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,280
focus on why.

1096
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,440
how is so .. i mean it's so easy to go vegan ..

1097
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,839
All right

1098
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,960
so i just want to add some commentary there

1099
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,040
to that piece that i just shared with you guys

1100
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,880
and i'm not sure if i made this clear in

1101
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,520
that last piece of commentary i offered but,

1102
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
that three-step process is not something

1103
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,240
you necessarily need to follow at the cubes.

1104
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,119
I'm just breaking that down to explain

1105
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,119
the traditional sales process

1106
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,720
and how it can be ... like how it's

1107
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,960
applicable here and how we usually get people ...

1108
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,560
you know what the process is to get them

1109
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,599
to that point of taking veganism seriously

1110
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,680
but i'm going to break down the process

1111
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,760
for you at the end of this

1112
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,960
in slides so i'm gonna break it down for you

1113
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,319
even more simpler and make it more clearer

1114
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,920
for you guys so

1115
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,960
just stick around for that

1116
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,079
at the end after this presentation is

1117
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,800
complete. So i just want to clarify i'm

1118
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,319
not asking you to do the three-step

1119
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,680
process at the cubes,

1120
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,359
that's not what we're asking you to do;

1121
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,680
we're just explaining the three-step process

1122
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,200
and showing you how this one little thing

1123
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,000
in sales is actually something that we

1124
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,040
can learn from

1125
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,440
and apply some of that here, in activism.

1126
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,880
...

1127
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,960
...

1128
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,599
...

1129
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,880
...

1130
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,640
...

1131
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,640
...

1132
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,160
...

1133
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,960
how is so .. i mean, it's so easy to go vegan

1134
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,240
in this day and age. Do we really think it's

1135
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,440
difficult for people?

1136
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,119
like we create all these programs and

1137
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,559
recipes and we try to

1138
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,079
make sure people have all the support in

1139
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,000
the world. is it really that difficult though?

1140
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,070
aren't we babying people?

1141
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,240
aren't we coddling people?

1142
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,000
because if you're convinced on why

1143
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,319
you need to be vegan, you just need to go and

1144
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,200
use google.

1145
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,079
in 2020 we have the internet, you can use

1146
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,680
google and ask any question there is

1147
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,119
about any ingredients,

1148
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,079
about any recipe, any product and you'll

1149
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,960
find out pretty quickly if it's vegan or not

1150
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,839
and that's the only compass you need to

1151
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,000
be vegan: is this vegan or is this not?

1152
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
there's two types of people in the world:

1153
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,760
those who say being vegan is easy,

1154
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,680
those who say being vegan is hard.

1155
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,280
those who say being vegan is easier

1156
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,720
focus on the victims;

1157
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,160
those who say being vegan is hard to

1158
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,040
focus on themselves.

1159
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,400
so whenever they bring up that

1160
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,000
distraction "oh i don't know how i could do this"

1161
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,200
how, whatever form of how that comes up,

1162
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,319
how is completely a distraction.

1163
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,359
if they're sold on why, how is easy

1164
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,040
plus we give them a card anyway

1165
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,680
so they get support

1166
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,520
they get whatever they need at the end

1167
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,599
so don't focus on how.

1168
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,920
another good question ...

1169
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,680
i just want to let you guys know also we

1170
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,839
updated our resource page in our cards.

1171
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,040
so when you're at the end of the

1172
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,359
interaction and you hand over a card,

1173
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,200
it's now updated and it says:

1174
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,000
will you stop being a human supremacist?

1175
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,240
this was just updated and

1176
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,640
it has our website cubeoftruth.com

1177
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,920
and that link now takes you to our resources page.

1178
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,720
so it's a lot more simple, i'm really

1179
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,319
proud of this new update

1180
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,240
and if you go over to our resources page

1181
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,839
we've updated that as well to make that

1182
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,119
even simpler.

1183
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,079
specifically the video section

1184
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,800
we've now put up

1185
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,960
a video that is the best of the best

1186
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,559
gary yourofsky moments in speeches

1187
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:25,680
and other content he's put up

1188
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,280
mainly his speeches but we've put the

1189
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,760
best of the best of gary yourofsky

1190
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,559
all in one video and it's about three hours

1191
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,599
so that's pretty cool because if

1192
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,200
they need further convincing

1193
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,079
that's the video. we're still going to

1194
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,760
keep the georgia tech speech up there

1195
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,680
the best speech you'll ever hear because

1196
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,640
it has all of the translations available

1197
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,280
and i think

1198
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,520
it covers like 30 languages or something

1199
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,480
so that's important, we need to keep that up there

1200
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
for that reason

1201
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,040
but this other one that's up there

1202
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,200
you can play using the caption feature on youtube,

1203
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,800
so it may still translate through that

1204
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,800
i don't ... well, yeah i don't know how that

1205
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,079
works in other countries

1206
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,160
or if it just creates a caption in english

1207
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,359
um yeah i'm not sure how that works but

1208
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,760
anyways we have that three-hour video

1209
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,839
for at least the english-speaking people

1210
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,040
of the world

1211
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,839
and that's pretty cool

1212
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,440
so let's get back into this

1213
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,480
... we give them a card anyway

1214
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,440
so they get support

1215
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,359
they get whatever they need at the end,

1216
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:33,440
so don't focus on health.

1217
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,800
another good question is,

1218
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,319
when you're tying in the benefit at the

1219
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,640
end of that three-step process,

1220
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,480
to ask the question: do you think it's

1221
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,640
possible to be against this?

1222
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,240
to be against what you're saying you're

1223
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,000
against while also supporting it?

1224
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,839
and it's a good question to just tie in

1225
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,760
hypocrisy again and also to tie in the

1226
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,599
fact that there is no way around this.

1227
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,960
there's no alternative: you're either an animal abuser

1228
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,559
or you're not. another thing i want to

1229
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,760
say about this approach that i'm

1230
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,040
teaching you right now is that this is

1231
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,520
way more satisfying to do

1232
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,040
than all these other approaches that

1233
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,559
involve pandering and

1234
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,559
compromising on the message and focusing

1235
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,480
on being liked and all this stuff.

1236
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,800
this is way more satisfying. i've noticed that

1237
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,400
over the last four years

1238
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,920
there was a huge surge in 2017/2018

1239
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,520
for street outreach in our network,

1240
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,839
and then it sort of dropped and i feel

1241
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:26,960
like people have lost

1242
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,280
interest in doing outreach.

1243
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,880
they don't really see the benefits and

1244
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,480
how successful it is and they're not really

1245
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,040
convinced on how effective it is anymore.

1246
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,880
when you're doing this approach

1247
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,400
you'll come to learn that

1248
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,960
all of your interactions are successful.

1249
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,640
even if the individual doesn't say that

1250
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,160
they're going to go vegan,

1251
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,760
you've at least told them what they need

1252
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,000
to hear, which is probably the only time

1253
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,400
they're going to hear it. and when you

1254
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,760
have that perspective

1255
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,240
every interaction is successful because,

1256
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,400
again, we're mediums of truth;

1257
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,480
we speak for the animals in the same way

1258
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,079
that we would want to be spoken for,

1259
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,000
if we were in their position.

1260
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,599
we have a rule that we only talk to

1261
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,520
people who stop at the cube

1262
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,640
and that's because we want to talk to

1263
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,640
people who are open-minded. and we also

1264
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,319
have an opening question that we ask

1265
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,599
"would you like to know why we're here?"

1266
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,079
because we need a commitment from them,

1267
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,240
so that this is a two-way conversation.

1268
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,520
so you shouldn't be talking to people

1269
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,760
who are obviously unreachable

1270
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,440
but at the end there they don't say

1271
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,800
they're going vegan

1272
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,319
then there's no reason for you to think

1273
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,640
that wasn't a successful interaction.

1274
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,680
so many times people don't even say

1275
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,160
anything affirmative to the outreacher

1276
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,599
and they become vegan.

1277
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,920
this happens so often now: we had someone

1278
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,200
at the melbourne workshop who was

1279
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,800
sitting and learning who said

1280
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,640
"i don't think that the outreacher who

1281
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,599
got me to go vegan at a cube a year ago in melbourne

1282
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,599
even knows that i went vegan, because

1283
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,119
i argued with the outreacher and walked off".

1284
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,559
that's another reason why we've removed

1285
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,040
the tallies, but i'll talk a little bit

1286
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,979
about that at the end.

1287
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:05,440
who here has

1288
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,680
not heard about socratic questioning?

1289
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,400
raise your hand

1290
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,440
alright fair few of you. this has been

1291
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,520
blown out of proportion a little bit too.

1292
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,839
socratic questioning is a tool,

1293
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,599
and it's a very good tool,

1294
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,640
but it is only a tool. it should be used

1295
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,640
within your interaction wherever you see fit,

1296
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,920
wherever it's supposed to be used,

1297
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,680
because asking questions is always a good idea,

1298
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,040
it's always a good way of

1299
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,880
gathering information from the person to

1300
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,880
see where they're at psychologically

1301
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,319
when it comes to this.

1302
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:37,680
but don't just use it throughout the

1303
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,359
whole interaction

1304
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:40,960
don't just ask question after question after question

1305
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,559
there's gonna be many times

1306
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,400
during the interaction where

1307
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,040
they give you the flow to speak

1308
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,720
and lecturing them in that moment

1309
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,640
is actually the right way to go.

1310
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,720
the reason why socratic questioning is

1311
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,440
there is because ...

1312
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,760
um so when i say giving you the ... like

1313
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,839
they're not necessarily giving you the flow,

1314
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,000
it's just a part/a moment in the

1315
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,839
interaction where they're not saying anything

1316
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,680
and it would be completely appropriate

1317
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,280
for you to say something

1318
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,839
and to make a statement at that point

1319
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,119
because (and i'm gonna break this down a

1320
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,040
little bit later when i do the slides)

1321
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,040
at that point when

1322
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,720
you make a statement or a closed-ended question

1323
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,240
or you don't even ask a

1324
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,359
question at all,

1325
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,559
at that point what you're doing is

1326
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,079
pushing the conversation forward

1327
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,680
and that's necessary sometimes.

1328
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,040
i'll break this down a little bit more detail,

1329
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,559
like i said, but i just wanted to add that

1330
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,960
commentary. let's get back to it.

1331
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,240
... they give you the flow to speak

1332
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,040
and lecturing them in that moment

1333
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,040
is actually the right way to go.

1334
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,720
the reason why socratic questioning is there is because

1335
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,200
we want to ask questions instead of make statements,

1336
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,880
but it doesn't mean that making

1337
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,319
statements is a bad idea.

1338
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,920
so i know that after i teach you guys this stuff

1339
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,160
it's just human nature that you will

1340
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,599
take this approach

1341
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,359
you'll apply your personality to it,

1342
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,720
which i want you to do,

1343
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,160
but then what i don't want you to do is

1344
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,240
butcher the approach itself and start

1345
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,119
saying things differently to how

1346
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,200
i'm suggesting that you say it.

1347
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,640
one little example is [when]

1348
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,200
we say "we" a lot when we're talking about

1349
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,359
non-vegans and what they do to animals:

1350
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:26,640
we're not in that situation anymore,

1351
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,000
so this is pandering when we say

1352
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,280
"the way we kill animals" or

1353
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,839
"why do we do this to them?"

1354
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,599
you're not doing this to them anymore so

1355
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,799
keep it accurate.

1356
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,799
again apply your personality by all means

1357
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,880
but just keep it accurate and

1358
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,760
listen to what you're saying.

1359
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,160
you should make it very clear that

1360
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,760
the individual you're speaking to needs

1361
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,520
to be held to account, not you.

1362
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,200
i think i get why we've been focusing on

1363
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,799
being liked more than

1364
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,400
promoting the message at hand here, and

1365
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,960
it's because the defensiveness that we see,

1366
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,400
coming from non-vegans, i think is

1367
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,680
more profound more astounding than

1368
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,319
perhaps any of the defensiveness

1369
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,000
that we see in any other group of

1370
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,440
culprits, of perpetrators, in the world.

1371
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,720
and i want to try to explain why i think that is.

1372
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,480
when it comes to eating, it's the most

1373
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,920
intimate connection we have with the

1374
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,079
outside world.

1375
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:25,839
this is why we see people getting a lot

1376
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,319
more cognitively dissonant and defensive

1377
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:30,240
over the food aspect of veganism,

1378
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,240
as opposed to the clothing aspects,

1379
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,160
or the testing aspects of veganism.

1380
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,760
more people are willing to accept that

1381
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,680
wearing fur is evil, but when it comes to

1382
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,280
changing their eating habits

1383
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,319
their defensiveness is truly astounding.

1384
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,839
this is what i experienced when i was

1385
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,839
promoting a plant-based diet for almost

1386
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,520
two years before i became an animal

1387
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,880
rights activist.

1388
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,119
so when you couple that with the fact

1389
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,200
that we are addressing the largest and

1390
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,200
longest-standing injustice

1391
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,319
with the most pressing issue of our time

1392
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,680
and the fact that this is the most

1393
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,359
intimate connection people have with the

1394
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,880
outside world,

1395
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,079
then you have to expect a nightmare.

1396
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,280
i'm only going to mention this one

1397
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,280
objection when people say "i only eat meat

1398
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,319
once in a while", have you heard that?

1399
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,000
they only say this to vegans and this

1400
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,680
only happens when they have a vegan in

1401
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,880
their environment.

1402
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,880
again this is just to prove to you

1403
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,400
how obvious this is,

1404
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,960
how obviously guilty people feel.

1405
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,559
it doesn't even take long for people to

1406
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,640
say that to a vegan "i don't eat meat

1407
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,440
that much anyway" .. i'm trying to eat less

1408
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,400
and less meat

1409
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,839
to not participate to this killing.

1410
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,040
i ate a lot of meat before,

1411
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,799
so i'm trying to eat less. it's hard to go

1412
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,000
really no meat for me, but i'm trying to do

1413
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,720
less and less so i'm not participating

1414
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,920
in those games.

1415
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,680
i lower my ...

1416
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,920
i don't cook food anymore,

1417
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,440
i don't cook meat anymore

1418
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,920
but if i go to restaurants sometimes

1419
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,300
i order meats. okay

1420
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,839
yeah, i'm not full vegan

1421
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,520
myself but i try to

1422
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,040
at least five days a week.

1423
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,000
why are you saying that?

1424
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,000
you wouldn't say that to your

1425
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,160
non-vegan friends

1426
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,359
and it's as black and white as that.

1427
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:22,880
you know you're only a little bit of an

1428
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,839
animal abuser

1429
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,520
again they would never do this with any

1430
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,880
other injustice they'd never be a little

1431
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,400
bit of a child abuser.

1432
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,359
the word speciesism, the words veganism,

1433
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,480
and the word animal exploitation

1434
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,040
and carnism as well, carnist people don't

1435
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,119
really understand these words.

1436
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,720
it doesn't really hit the way that we

1437
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,040
want them to hit. i'm not saying don't

1438
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,160
use these words,

1439
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,880
i say vegan all the time, but i want you

1440
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,599
to focus

1441
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,960
way more on what these words mean

1442
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,319
and use words like human supremacism,

1443
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:59,760
because that clearly explains speciesism,

1444
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,240
and it clearly explains what being a

1445
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,040
non-vegan

1446
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,319
is all about: human supremacism.

1447
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:06,880
and in terms of

1448
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,280
exploitation i think people think of

1449
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,559
sweatshop workers

1450
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,880
and i don't know they think of

1451
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,480
exploitation the music industry, in the

1452
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,640
porn industry they don't really think

1453
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,760
of the animals being

1454
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,079
hacked apart having the children taken

1455
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:22,960
away from them

1456
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,960
the most torturous things imaginable

1457
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,720
happening to these innocent beings i

1458
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,400
don't really think of exploitation like that.

1459
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,599
so it is exploitation but the better

1460
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,079
word to use here is animal abuse

1461
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,599
and human supremacism.

1462
00:59:39,299 --> 00:59:40,640
statistics: a lot of the times we

1463
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,359
feel the need to bring up statistics.

1464
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,920
you know 50 of the world's crops are used to..

1465
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,480
you know 3 trillion animals are slaughtered every year..

1466
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,559
by all means:

1467
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,480
do this but please keep this to an

1468
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,640
absolute minimum,

1469
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,760
because we're not supposed to be highly

1470
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,920
educated and academic and it doesn't

1471
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,040
need to be

1472
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,799
in order for people to take this very

1473
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:05,040
simple issue seriously.

1474
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,480
animal abuse is wrong and there's no

1475
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,480
justification for it.

1476
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,400
we don't need statistics to prove that

1477
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,839
to people necessarily.

1478
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,319
if people want to talk about this to you

1479
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,160
and they bring up statistics

1480
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,880
and they want to debate statistics,

1481
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,880
make sure that you're not

1482
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,280
feeding into the distraction too much.

1483
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,079
i want to talk about vegetarianism real quick.

1484
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,400
i think vegetarianism is a cancer

1485
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,720
to the animal rights movement

1486
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,520
and we think that for some reason

1487
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,359
in this movement we think that vegetarians

1488
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,280
are closer to this message,

1489
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,240
they're our allies. again we would never

1490
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,480
do this with ...

1491
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,440
i just wanna take a moment

1492
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,799
to call myself out.

1493
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,400
this is the holding non-vegans

1494
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,119
accountable 2.0 workshop,

1495
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,720
but i'm going to take a sweet moment to

1496
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,240
hold myself accountable

1497
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,599
because i just said in this movement we think

1498
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,440
that vegetarians are the same .. whatever i said.

1499
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,359
i don't think that anymore in fact i've

1500
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,960
probably been the most vocal about this

1501
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,720
in the animal rights movement but

1502
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,040
yeah i was just talking about how

1503
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,000
we need to be accurate with our words,

1504
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,280
so i just want to pull myself up there

1505
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,040
and say that i no longer talk like this

1506
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,680
about vegetarian. i never really did ever so

1507
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,839
yeah ...

1508
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,359
...

1509
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,680
...

1510
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,720
...

1511
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,040
...

1512
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,760
...

1513
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,520
...

1514
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,640
i want to talk about vegetarianism real quick

1515
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,559
i think vegetarianism is a cancer

1516
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,599
to the animal rights movement

1517
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,000
and we think that for some reason in this

1518
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,839
movement we think that vegetarians are

1519
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,599
closer to this message,

1520
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,559
they're our allies. again we would never

1521
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:54,960
do this with any other injustice

1522
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:00,400
and vegetarian is no different to paleo.

1523
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,119
i mean vegetarians will stop eating meat

1524
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,880
then that's no different to what the

1525
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,720
paleo crew are doing,

1526
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,359
because they don't eat dairy,

1527
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:12,319
and it's been argued

1528
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:14,240
that the dairy industry could be the

1529
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,720
cruelest industry in the world.

1530
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,559
we should really be calling the paleo

1531
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:21,839
crew our allies,

1532
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,720
not vegetarians, but do you see how

1533
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,400
insane that sounds?

1534
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,079
me even saying that we would call the

1535
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,039
paleo guys our allies?

1536
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,839
just because meat is obviously cruel to animals

1537
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,960
it doesn't mean dairy isn't and eggs isn't

1538
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,559
and you all know that because

1539
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,039
you're vegan and you already know this information

1540
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,160
but when we even slightly

1541
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,640
give in to this idea that vegetarians

1542
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,359
are on our side, then we perpetuate

1543
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,359
this myth even further.

1544
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,280
we are the ones who are spreading

1545
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,200
wrong message here.

1546
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,960
so when someone says "don't worry i'm

1547
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,880
vegetarian, you don't need to talk to me",

1548
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,720
your response should be "you're actually

1549
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,160
our target market"

1550
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,720
and in fact you have more of a

1551
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,599
responsibility to go harder on those individuals

1552
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:10,640
because they already think they're doing enough.

1553
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,599
they feel entitled and how dare you tell them

1554
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:14,880
they're doing any different is the

1555
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,960
attitude they usually give you..

1556
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,799
i appreciate all that you're doing just

1557
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,480
wanted you to know that i'm a vegetarian that

1558
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,400
drinks almond milk. okay,

1559
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,319
that's good.. local farm .. interesting ..

1560
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:25,680
i'm just saying like you might want to

1561
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,200
just focus your resource on someone else

1562
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,359
because i totally am already on board.

1563
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:30,240
i got that.

1564
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,400
was animal cruelty one of the reasons

1565
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,319
why you became vegetarian?

1566
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,039
yes, have been vegetarian since i was 19 i'm 45

1567
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:38,559
that's about 27 years of vegetarian.

1568
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,240
one of the footage that we chose here is

1569
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,079
also from local like

1570
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,079
free range like egg farms. let me ask you

1571
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,000
a question, because you say

1572
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,599
that you usually get your eggs from like

1573
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:49,680
local like free range farms.

1574
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,640
where did they get their hens from?

1575
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:53,440
like for example

1576
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,440
her father's chickens that run around

1577
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,960
his yard

1578
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,440
so ..like.. they are .. i don't know where he

1579
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,559
gets his hens from..

1580
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,720
because what sex is important in the

1581
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,880
egg industry? males or females?

1582
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,000
obviously the females. so when people get

1583
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,880
hens they get them from a breeder in

1584
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,160
hatcheries, even like

1585
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,240
for people that just want to get like a

1586
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,160
egg laying hens.

1587
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,760
males and females are born a different color:

1588
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,319
if you're born female you're thrown to the left,

1589
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:21,520
if you're a male you're thrown to the right.

1590
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,680
where do you think the males go?

1591
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,000
i get it ... directly into a blender.

1592
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm never gonna be a vegan,

1593
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,200
so i'm doing everything i can to

1594
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,240
minimize my impact, but i'm not going to be a vegan.

1595
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,280
would you consider animal cruelty to be an injustice?

1596
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,480
yes, I would. would you take that same stance

1597
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,240
with any other injustice? because you do

1598
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,039
recognize that there is cruelty in eggs, right?

1599
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,619
sure

1600
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,960
so i found with the majority of vegetarians

1601
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,400
actually they're harder to get through,

1602
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,680
they're not our allies,

1603
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,119
they're not closest to this message,

1604
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,319
they're pompous. sure, there's vegetarians

1605
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,319
out there who didn't know better and

1606
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,400
i've met many of those too

1607
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,000
they just didn't know better

1608
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,520
once you tell them they go vegan on the spot.

1609
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,799
that's the dream circumstance but

1610
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,720
i'm saying most people are not like this

1611
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,160
if they're vegetarian.

1612
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,599
imagine if all vegetarians were vegan

1613
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,359
the percentage of vegetarians is always

1614
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:19,280
way larger than the percentage of vegans

1615
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,440
when they do those statistics.

1616
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,280
imagine if all the vegetarians were

1617
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,960
outreached effectively and they went vegan:

1618
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,599
we would have way more vegans on our side.

1619
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,599
also when people at the end of your

1620
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,160
outreach will say "i'm gonna try to do better",

1621
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,319
"i'll try, i'm gonna try to go vegan",

1622
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,680
please

1623
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,960
do not use the word "try" and do not let people

1624
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,680
use the word "try". would you try to be a

1625
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,039
non-racist?

1626
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,280
would you try not to be a child abuser?

1627
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,319
or would you just fucking stop,

1628
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,839
once you realize that it's wrong?

1629
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,280
again, don't let them off the hook: let them

1630
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,359
know that there is a moral imperative here.

1631
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:58,640
when someone says "i'm gonna try", what i say

1632
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,880
in order to get them to rid themselves

1633
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,319
of this "try" nonsense,

1634
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,599
is to compare it to any other injustice,

1635
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,520
like i just compared it to child abuse

1636
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,880
and racism etc.

1637
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,000
would you say that you would try?

1638
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,960
or would you just stop?

1639
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,079
and that usually corrects that for people,

1640
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,839
very quickly ...

1641
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,079
i'm going to get into this a little

1642
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,760
bit more later,

1643
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,799
but i want to add this piece in here and say

1644
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:34,799
that we have had another update to this section.

1645
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:37,119
we're constantly seeking to improve here guys,

1646
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,000
we're constantly making software updates

1647
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,799
and one of them is this one here: when we

1648
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,400
compare to other injustices we've actually found

1649
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,799
... see ... okay so ... my analysis on this

1650
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:53,119
is that human beings only truly care

1651
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:57,200
about themselves, that's it.

1652
01:06:57,219 --> 01:07:00,880
so when we say child abuse, racism, sexism,

1653
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,559
feminism, whatever it is, we're relying

1654
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,720
upon how much they care about those issues

1655
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,480
and if they're not an activist, when it comes to those

1656
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,160
issues, we shouldn't expect that they care

1657
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,319
a great deal about those issues, should we?

1658
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:22,079
so we've found that the most effective thing to do

1659
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,319
in all situations is in fact hold them

1660
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,240
accountable to themselves.

1661
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,400
so in other words, instead of comparing

1662
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,720
it to an injustice that involves

1663
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,839
other groups of humans how about you just

1664
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,680
ask them about themselves? how would you feel

1665
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,160
if someone was torturing you, enslaving you

1666
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,960
and was going to murder you?

1667
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,960
and the excuse your oppressors used

1668
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,240
was "i'm trying to do less of it",

1669
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,920
"i'm only going to cut"

1670
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,440
they say they're only going to cut your leg off

1671
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,680
uh you're probably gonna die from a doe

1672
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,119
so is that better than not

1673
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,319
killing i mean, you know it's essentially

1674
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:03,119
putting them

1675
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:06,240
in the victim's position and saying

1676
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,200
"what if someone was

1677
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,920
to enslave torture and murder you less,

1678
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,440
but never ever liberate you from your oppression?"

1679
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,238
how would you feel? would you want to be

1680
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,399
liberated if you were the victim?

1681
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:20,560
or would you want these nonsense baby

1682
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,880
steps that don't really go anywhere?

1683
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,359
so, when you're comparing to other groups

1684
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,198
of humans it might be most effective for

1685
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:31,279
you to in fact,

1686
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:35,120
according to our latest update and my analysis on this,

1687
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,839
rely on the fact that human beings truly

1688
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,158
only care about themselves.

1689
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,120
they at least care

1690
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,479
more about themselves

1691
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,920
than anything else, any other group of humans

1692
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,520
and i'm speaking generally for most

1693
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,960
people here; this is why

1694
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,479
i'm trying to get deep into what is the most effective,

1695
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,640
because there is no perfect approach

1696
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,799
for every single individual on

1697
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,359
the planet, that doesn't exist.

1698
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,279
what i can only teach you is most

1699
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:04,799
effective for most people

1700
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:08,479
and i'm going to continue to expand that

1701
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,520
and improve on that as much as possible.

1702
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,480
let's get back into it.

1703
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,238
would you say that you would try?

1704
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,198
or would you just stop?

1705
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,399
and that usually corrects that for people,

1706
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,439
very quickly ... i want to try to

1707
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,399
be better ... there's no trying when it

1708
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:30,080
comes to justice,

1709
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:33,120
you can't try to be non-racist,

1710
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,080
you're either non-racist

1711
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:36,238
or you're a racist, and i say that

1712
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,399
comparison because you understand injustice

1713
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:41,839
in that context, but justice is justice.

1714
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,359
what's evil is evil you can't have it

1715
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,120
both ways.

1716
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:49,040
what's right is right what's wrong is wrong, so

1717
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,198
don't try, you have to do it. do you think

1718
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:52,158
you'll go vegan?

1719
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,199
um i can definitely try yeah

1720
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:58,000
wow i love my family here but i can stop

1721
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,440
i can spread it through my family make

1722
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,640
sure that they eat less..

1723
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,840
now i'm just going to leave you with

1724
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,560
this to think about because you said try:

1725
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:08,080
would we say that with any other

1726
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,199
injustice would we try to not be a child abuser?

1727
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:14,239
or would we just do it?

1728
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,679
yeah so please don't compromise on this

1729
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,679
injustice because the animals suffer as

1730
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,920
a result of that.

1731
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,120
you really just need to get out there

1732
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,040
and do this and see

1733
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,040
how effective it is for yourself

1734
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,800
that one guy he was talking to

1735
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,400
so anyone can do this and i highly

1736
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,920
recommend it and

1737
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,840
the tallies, as you know we've removed

1738
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,320
our tallies, we used to

1739
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,280
try and measure how effective we are and

1740
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,600
that was the reason why we had the tally there

1741
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,360
we tried to have some kind of metric

1742
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,800
that we wanted to use to show that these events,

1743
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,640
this form of street outreach is really

1744
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,040
effective, but the mistake that we made

1745
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,719
is that you can't really tell if someone

1746
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,040
is going to go vegan or not.

1747
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,960
you just have to speak for the animals

1748
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,120
in the way that you would want to be spoken for

1749
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,640
if you're in their position.

1750
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,640
say the correct things and that's

1751
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,760
a successful conversation.

1752
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,280
a lot of the times people say they're

1753
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,199
going to go vegan and while that's still

1754
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,840
a good thing (i'm not saying that's not

1755
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,360
a good indication if someone says

1756
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,280
they're going to go vegan, they may very

1757
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,040
well stick to that)

1758
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,760
but i actually have examples of many

1759
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,560
cases of people saying they're going vegan after

1760
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,960
listening to me and they do not go vegan.

1761
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,400
you don't know what's going on in

1762
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,239
people's minds and what's going on in

1763
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,159
their hearts and what they're going to

1764
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,000
experience after they've talked to you.

1765
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,960
you don't know if they're going to

1766
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,320
continue arguing with their friends

1767
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,080
about what you've talked to them about

1768
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,840
and then that leading to them going

1769
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,320
vegan because all of their friends

1770
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,960
made stupid comments and one of their

1771
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,800
friend held them to account again

1772
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,719
and that rang in their head and they

1773
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:54,080
were thinking about it for a week

1774
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,159
and they couldn't let it go and then

1775
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,080
finally they conceded

1776
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,000
to the hypocrisy and they became vegan.

1777
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,199
you just don't know, you don't know the process.

1778
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,960
another thing is that hypocrisy: i just

1779
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,040
want to go back to that real quick.

1780
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,480
it's the reason why each of us went vegan for sure.

1781
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,320
there's a story that i have on my

1782
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,440
youtube of Gary Yourofsky:

1783
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:16,960
i was in the car with him, he was telling

1784
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,239
this really awesome story that ...

1785
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:25,840
all right, okay guys i want you to pay attention

1786
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,000
to this point i'm making here because

1787
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,920
i only realized how powerful and significant

1788
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,199
this point was when i watched this workshop back.

1789
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:37,920
what i have successfully pointed out here

1790
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,880
is, well you'll hear my point in a moment but

1791
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,000
this is so tremendously profound and

1792
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,760
i really want you to understand what i'm

1793
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:48,800
saying here

1794
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,679
but it's a story about Gary and

1795
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,120
i haven't even pointed this out to Gary yet

1796
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,120
but i'm going to do so soon

1797
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,360
but one thing i learned from him is that

1798
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,159
he didn't go vegan because of that elephant

1799
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,400
in the circus and he didn't go vegan

1800
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,920
because of the pigs that he saw being tortured

1801
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:10,880
and murdered at thorn apple valley pig slaughterhouse.

1802
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,520
that's the story he's told the world

1803
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,920
and i believe that that's

1804
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,120
what he felt was the catalyst for a long time,

1805
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:20,560
but when i was chilling with him in Detroit,

1806
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,520
he told me a story

1807
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,520
which i recorded and i put up on my YouTube

1808
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,880
and that story he tells

1809
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,600
a new story about how he went vegan and

1810
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,159
what was really the catalyst to

1811
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,679
change him and it's really powerful

1812
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:41,360
if you want to understand

1813
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,520
what it takes to truly get people to go vegan

1814
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,600
because if we can understand

1815
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,640
how the best activists in the world have gone vegan

1816
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,040
then that's a pretty good indicator

1817
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,159
because that's what we're trying to

1818
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:53,520
shoot for here not just people to go vegan

1819
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,280
but we need people to speak up and

1820
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,840
to be effective when they speak up.

1821
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,480
let's look at how activists went vegan: that's a great

1822
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,640
thing to observe and learn from so,

1823
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,719
without further ado, please pay attention...

1824
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:10,400
one of their friend held them to account again

1825
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,719
and that rang in their head

1826
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,080
and they were thinking about it for

1827
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,840
a week and they couldn't let it go

1828
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,640
and then finally they conceded to the

1829
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,480
hypocrisy and they became vegan.

1830
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,440
you just don't know, you don't know the process.

1831
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,280
another thing is that hypocrisy:

1832
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,280
i just want to go back to that real quick.

1833
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,800
it's the reason why each of us went vegan for sure.

1834
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,640
there's a story that i have on my

1835
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,679
youtube of Gary Yourofsky;

1836
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,280
i was in the car with him, he was telling

1837
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,880
this really awesome story that i'd never

1838
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,920
heard before

1839
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,360
about how a hockey team in Detroit

1840
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,640
used to throw octopuses onto the ice

1841
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,480
and he was an animal rights guy at the time

1842
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,320
every time someone would score a

1843
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,600
goal they would do this

1844
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,280
and he was an animal rights guy at the

1845
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,120
time who was protesting this

1846
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,120
and he called a radio station

1847
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,480
and he started saying "what's next?

1848
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,600
are we going to have all these other

1849
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,199
teams with sharks and lions on their

1850
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,960
names also throwing those animals onto

1851
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,480
the ice every time they score a goal?"

1852
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,040
and he was going nuts and then

1853
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,080
the radio guy said "whoa

1854
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,800
Gary, chill chill what did you have for

1855
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,600
dinner last night?"

1856
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,080
and then Gary was like "a salad"

1857
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,040
and it was that moment that he realized

1858
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,560
that no other answer could have been acceptable

1859
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,120
and the hypocrisy was what got

1860
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,280
Gary Yourofsky to go vegan.

1861
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,040
that night he said was the night that

1862
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,480
he went vegan.

1863
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,800
i heard stories about the elephant story

1864
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,199
in Michigan he talked about a circus incident

1865
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,640
and then there was this other incident

1866
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,640
but it wasn't that

1867
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,560
he was going to thorn apple valley pig farm  in michigan

1868
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,560
and seeing pigs being slaughtered

1869
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,320
every day he kept going and witnessing

1870
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,239
he couldn't believe that this was going on

1871
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:53,679
he hadn't gone vegan until that guy

1872
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,880
said "you're a hypocrite"

1873
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,120
so please understand how powerful that is

1874
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,080
even the best activists that we know of

1875
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,840
the most effective

1876
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,520
this is what caused them to go vegan

1877
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:08,880
it's the same thing for me

1878
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,440
it's the same exact story for me

1879
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,320
when i realized

1880
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,080
from listening to Gary that i was a

1881
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:16,400
hypocrite if i wasn't vegan

1882
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,159
and there's no way you can justify

1883
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,600
even a little bit

1884
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,520
of animal consumption

1885
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,520
that's when i became vegan

1886
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,800
but prior to that i was bullshitting

1887
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,719
i was plant-based i would eat salmon sometimes

1888
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:29,920
i'd wear leather

1889
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,360
i was raw vegan while wearing leather jackets.

1890
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,320
i could take you through a typical

1891
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,920
interaction if you'd like,

1892
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,920
from start to end, would you like that?

1893
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,520
yeah yep

1894
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,280
so we start the conversation by

1895
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,760
"would you like to know why we're here?"

1896
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,440
they need to say something affirmative

1897
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,520
for the conversation to go ahead

1898
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,400
they either say yes or they try to guess

1899
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,400
and that's an affirmative answer.

1900
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,480
so you continue "yes what we're doing

1901
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,040
here is we're showing the standard practice footage

1902
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,319
of what happens in the meat, dairy and egg industries

1903
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:04,260
and other industries that abuse animals

1904
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,280
and we're also showing

1905
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,040
free-range grass-fed organic cage-free

1906
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,960
humane certified...

1907
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,160
hey guys would you like to know why we're here?

1908
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,380
i'm guessing against animal cruelty

1909
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,520
that is a good guess what we're showing

1910
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,120
on the screens is the

1911
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,920
animal industries meat dairy and eggs

1912
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,520
and other industries also

1913
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,159
that abuse animals for products.

1914
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,679
would you like to hear what we're doing here?

1915
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,800
sure! cool, yes what we're doing is we're

1916
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,719
showing the behind the scenes

1917
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,960
of industries that abuse animals

1918
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,159
so this is in the meat industry

1919
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,800
dairy industry egg industry

1920
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,640
we're showing is also the best of the best

1921
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,800
so this is free range, cage free, humane certified.

1922
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,840
all right. would you like to hear what

1923
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,239
we're doing here? sure. yes what we're doing is

1924
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:51,600
we're showing the behind the scenes

1925
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,480
of industries that abuse animals

1926
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,520
like meat dairy eggs leather..

1927
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,719
the next question you have

1928
01:17:58,719 --> 01:17:59,920
to ask them is

1929
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,880
"how do you feel about animal abuse?"

1930
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,840
usually they say

1931
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,880
well it's obviously wrong 100% against it

1932
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,920
that's what they usually say, people say.

1933
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,520
"okay so do you think this is wrong?"

1934
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,440
"would you say this is evil?" this is me doubling

1935
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,199
down to make sure i've owned them on

1936
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,360
this point "would you say this is evil?"..

1937
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,640
would you say that this is evil?

1938
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,920
yes. treating animals like our slaves?

1939
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,480
yeah. would you say that stabbing animals

1940
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,560
to death for a sandwich is wrong?

1941
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,360
yeah yeah yeah that's orrible. what are your

1942
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,480
initial thoughts? how does this kind of

1943
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,560
stuff make you guys feel?

1944
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,040
guilty

1945
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,239
yeah so it's safe to say that you guys

1946
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:41,920
are against animal abuse?

1947
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,960
yeah for sure. i want you ...

1948
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,120
all right, i just want to clarify

1949
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,880
that, again, there was an update here that

1950
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,719
we've made. i don't think that

1951
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:54,080
closed-ended questions

1952
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,840
are actually as effective as open-ended

1953
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,040
questions in this segment of the interaction,

1954
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,480
so instead of saying "do you think stabbing

1955
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,880
an animal to death for a sandwich

1956
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,760
or torturing animals to death is evil?",

1957
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,800
"do you think that's evil?" / "do you think

1958
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,320
that's wrong?" it's a closed-ended

1959
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,239
question, it's an obvious question

1960
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:13,920
it's in fact more important for you to say

1961
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,159
"how do you feel about animal abuse?" and

1962
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:17,679
then when they say

1963
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,440
"i feel guilty, i feel horrible, it's terrible.."

1964
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,199
and then

1965
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:25,040
the next thing you need to do to just confirm

1966
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,960
their position on animal abuse is to say

1967
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,560
"is it safe to say that you are against animal abuse?"

1968
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,800
and in some circumstances i might even

1969
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,800
triple down and say "would you say it's evil?".

1970
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,040
so you need to ask that open-ended question first

1971
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,840
and then the closed-ended question just to

1972
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,840
confirm and seal it off.

1973
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,440
now, that will make sense why you need to do

1974
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,000
that as i continue on with the approach here

1975
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,840
showing you the step-by-step process...

1976
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,080
the footage, how does it make you feel?

1977
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,280
it makes me cringe

1978
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,679
cringe? why do you think it makes you

1979
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:58,560
feel that way?

1980
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,280
because i love the animals. you love

1981
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,080
animals,

1982
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,840
interesting, so safe to say you're

1983
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,199
against animal abuse?

1984
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:08,480
animal cruelty? absolutely... yeah absolutely,

1985
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,880
most people say "yes absolutely". now,

1986
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,400
if they say no

1987
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,440
they're either drunk or

1988
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,639
trolling and either way you shouldn't be

1989
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:20,159
having a conversation with those people,

1990
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:22,239
they're not reachable.

1991
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:24,159
again this is so obviously wrong, i mean

1992
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,679
you're seeing animals being hacked apart

1993
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,199
on the screens, how could anybody say

1994
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,280
this is okay?

1995
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,440
so usually they say that. then the next

1996
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,280
step would be "okay what do you think

1997
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,360
you can do about it as an individual?"

1998
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,120
so we've gone from the first step of the

1999
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,120
process within the three-step process of

2000
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,120
emotional conviction, really quickly

2001
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,639
moving to the second step which is

2002
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,159
accountability "what do you think you can

2003
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,239
do about it?" and

2004
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:47,920
again most of the time i actually get

2005
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,600
"i think i could stop

2006
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,320
eating them", "i could become vegan" ...

2007
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,560
so what do you think you can do about it as individuals?

2008
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,840
stop, become vegan, yes become vegan

2009
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,239
it's very simple isn't it? yeah.

2010
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:01,920
that's why i'm saying this is so fucking

2011
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,679
obvious to people,

2012
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,840
it's not that complex, it's really not,

2013
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,840
it's very obvious.

2014
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,520
so, the interaction, so then you say

2015
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,019
"what do you think you can do about this as an individual?"

2016
01:21:11,019 --> 01:21:12,560
usually they say "well i can

2017
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,639
stop being vegan" but if they say something

2018
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,120
that a lot of the times they'll actually

2019
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,639
try to distract and say well

2020
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:22,960
you can protest the government protest these industries

2021
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,280
again you deal with the objection

2022
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,600
bring it back to accountability that's all you're doing

2023
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,960
deal with the objection anchor it back to accountability

2024
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,800
once you have the concede after dealing

2025
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,880
with all of those back and forth back and forth

2026
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,960
once you have them concede,

2027
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,159
then you bring in the benefits

2028
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,360
"do you know what the number one benefit

2029
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,600
is to be vegan?"

2030
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,719
usually their ears perk up when you say benefit

2031
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:47,760
and they look at you like "what is it?

2032
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,719
i want to know" and that's when you say

2033
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,400
"well obviously the benefit for them is

2034
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,239
they're no longer tortured and abused

2035
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:56,159
for you, you're no longer the reason

2036
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,679
that this happens to them, but the

2037
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,360
benefit for you

2038
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,960
is that you no longer have to be an

2039
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,920
animal abuser."

2040
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:08,960
right so a new update again and

2041
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,679
i'm gonna break this down in the slides that i'll do later

2042
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:15,360
but the update here is to say

2043
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:18,719
"for the first time

2044
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,760
you will have the opportunity to stop

2045
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,520
being a hypocrite"

2046
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,459
instead of saying "you will no longer be a hypocrite"

2047
01:22:26,459 --> 01:22:28,560
and i'm saying this because many

2048
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,840
vegans are straight-up hypocrites

2049
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,800
but when you become vegan

2050
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,040
it is the first time in human life

2051
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,639
you can stop you have the opportunity to stop

2052
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:44,480
being a hypocrite because you address

2053
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:47,199
the biggest hypocrisy i think humans

2054
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:50,639
are engaging in. so i just want to

2055
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,679
clarify that it doesn't automatically

2056
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,360
remove you from hypocrisy when you

2057
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,360
become vegan, but it does give you an

2058
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:01,280
opportunity to truly end hypocrisy.

2059
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,199
..and you no longer have to be hypocrite

2060
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,120
... you're no longer the

2061
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,360
reason that this happens to them but the

2062
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,960
benefit for you

2063
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,639
is that you no longer have to be an

2064
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,800
animal abuser and you no longer have to

2065
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,239
be a hypocrite because you say that

2066
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,239
you're against animal abuse..

2067
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,679
do you guys know what the number one benefit is

2068
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,600
of not supporting what's on the screen?

2069
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,920
from being vegan?

2070
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,480
any guesses?

2071
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,520
so the number one benefit obviously for

2072
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,719
the animals

2073
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,000
once you're vegan then they're no longer

2074
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,719
tortured and abused because of you

2075
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,239
so they're relieved of that

2076
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,239
and then the best benefit for you guys

2077
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,400
is that because in the beginning of the conversation

2078
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:43,920
you stated that you're against animal

2079
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,880
abuse you're horrified by what's on the screens

2080
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,199
when you're vegan for the first time

2081
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:52,800
then you no longer have to be a hypocrite

2082
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,880
never thought of it like that

2083
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,320
do you know the number one benefit

2084
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,560
of going vegan?

2085
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,239
the number one benefit obviously for the

2086
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:08,080
animals once you're vegan then they're no longer

2087
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,239
tortured because of you, so they're

2088
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:11,360
relieved of that

2089
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,000
and then the best benefit for you is

2090
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,719
that because you said you're against animal abuse

2091
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,360
when you're vegan for the first time

2092
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:22,560
you no longer have to be a hypocrite

2093
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,679
and do you know the number one benefit

2094
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,280
when you stop supporting animals and be

2095
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,440
vegan? the number one benefit of that?

2096
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,320
you're not part of a crazy-ass society

2097
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,520
that's actually really close

2098
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,360
it would first be for the animals would no longer

2099
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,040
be abused by you but as an individual

2100
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,159
this is really important on

2101
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,719
an individual level since you've told me

2102
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,159
in this conversation that you are against

2103
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,040
animal abuse

2104
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:46,880
and you're clearly disturbed of what you

2105
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,960
see on the screen.

2106
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,639
when you become vegan for the first time

2107
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,000
you no longer have to be a hypocrite.

2108
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
do you know the number one benefit

2109
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,440
of being vegan?

2110
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,920
like the number one benefit, any guesses?

2111
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,040
like health?

2112
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:04,800
health. so health is conditional

2113
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,800
you can absolutely receive some amazing

2114
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,840
health benefits

2115
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,960
depending on how you coordinate your lifestyle

2116
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,880
but the number one benefit would first

2117
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,560
of course be for the animals

2118
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,239
they would no longer be abused because of you

2119
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:18,400
but as individuals

2120
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,639
the number one benefit would be

2121
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,719
if you say you're against animal abuse

2122
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:24,639
and you look at these screens

2123
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:26,560
and you're disgusted by it

2124
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,179
then you no longer have to be a hypocrite

2125
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:31,280
it's really important that

2126
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,920
we don't just say have a nice day

2127
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,520
after telling them the benefit

2128
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,199
it's really important that you ask them

2129
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:38,960
what they're going to do

2130
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,080
that's how you should end the

2131
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,159
interaction "so what do you think you'll do?"

2132
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,760
and when people say i'll try to do better

2133
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:45,120
then you tie in the fact that

2134
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,280
they shouldn't try they need to do

2135
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,080
and the best way to end it is

2136
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,360
"so what do you think you'll do?"

2137
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,580
it's really important that you close off strongly

2138
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,199
because then it's like

2139
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,040
the whole interaction was for nothing

2140
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,120
if you don't close it off properly

2141
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,480
without that close it really like seals

2142
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,679
the whole conversation and

2143
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,360
they really understand what the imperative is

2144
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,040
they're after. after seeing this footage

2145
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,000
after having this conversation

2146
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,120
what do you think you'll do moving

2147
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:12,100
forward regarding this suffering?

2149
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,639
i mean something had to be done but..

2150
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:22,639
so like just right there when hudson

2151
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,760
said "what do you think you'll do about

2152
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,840
this suffering?"

2153
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,120
i'm just going to add this on and

2154
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,360
i'm sure hudson will appreciate this because

2155
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,880
he always appreciates these little

2156
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,120
updates but he's absolutely killing it

2157
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,880
in these examples

2158
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,480
the suffering that you cause

2159
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,720
the suffering that's happening because of you

2160
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,960
just a little

2161
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:47,040
added update that i would make there

2162
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,159
and i'll just go back..

2163
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:50,960
after seeing this footage, after having this

2164
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,159
conversation what do you think you'll do

2165
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,159
moving forward regarding this

2166
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,100
suffering?

just keep in mind that until

2171

2173
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,600
so i guess i spoke too soon there

2174
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:18,080
because he ties in right here

2175
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,000
that further accountability that

2176
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,280
i was looking to add into

2177
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:25,199
that comment he just made so let's just retract

2178
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,120
that comment i made because he really

2179
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,440
does double down at the end here

2180
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,199
to make sure that this is happening

2181
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,440
because of the individual

2182
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,560
so let's just continue ..

2183
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,440
something had to be done but

2184
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:40,560
i don't know

2185
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,080
just keep in mind that until

2186
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,960
the day comes that you're vegan

2187
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,920
animals are going to be

2188
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,320
victimized and abused because of you

2189
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,600
so just think about what side of history

2190
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,800
you want to stand on when it comes to

2191
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,600
stamping out

2192
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,239
this particular injustice. what do you

2193
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,360
think you guys are going to do

2194
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,719
leaving here? i feel like

2195
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,400
i'll i'll think more about it i feel

2196
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,760
like the next time i have me but whether

2197
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,040
they come vegan

2198
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,719
i don't want to see that in my future to

2199
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:10,239
be honest but

2200
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,639
i mean yeah.. just remember until the day

2201
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:14,400
that you do align those actions

2202
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,760
with the words that you said during

2203
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,320
this conversation that animals will be abused

2204
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,679
because of you

2205
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:21,600
so just decide what side of history

2206
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,040
you want to stand on

2207
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,920
what do you guys think you're going to

2208
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,320
do after seeing this footage?

2209
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,360
i don't know i'm definitely going to try

2210
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,199
to be more conscious about it, i don't

2211
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:30,880
know if i'm ready to fully be a vegan but

2212
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,000
i don't know

2213
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,760
what i'll leave you guys with is that

2214
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,920
you agree that when you're taking baby steps

2215
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,400
just keep in mind that for however long

2216
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,080
you are taking baby steps

2217
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:47,679
animals are going to be tortured for you guys so

2218
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:51,440
when you're ready to stop abusing animals and

2219
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,639
stop being hypocrites then you guys

2220
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:56,560
can be vegan so think about what side of

2221
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,000
history you guys want to stand on.

2222
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,199
all right what do you think you're going

2223
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:01,199
to do leaving here?

2224
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:03,280
we rethink my fucking process in terms

2225
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:04,800
of what i eat

2226
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,440
for sure because i want to i want to be

2227
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:11,840
a better person.  that's crazy

2228
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,520
just understand that until the day that

2229
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,159
you do decide to align your actions

2230
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,440
with the beliefs that you said you've had

2231
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,440
during this conversation

2232
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:22,560
the animals will be abused because of you

2233
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,480
so just decide what side of history you

2234
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,760
want to stand on

2235
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,120
when stamping out this particular injustice

2236
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,960
now i know this seems confrontational

2237
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,280
you guys are ..

2238
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,719
i just want to take a moment to give a

2239
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:39,280
quick shout out to jacob and hudson

2240
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,320
for those very fine examples they are

2241
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:43,920
killing it right now

2242
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,639
and really adopting this approach whoops

2243
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,480
i hope the audio was okay there but just

2244
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,920
want to shout out to jacob and hudson

2245
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,920
they're doing great work

2246
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,280
you're thinking [ __ ] i don't know if i

2247
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:59,360
could just decide what side of history

2248
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,719
you want to stand on

2249
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:02,239
when stamping out this particular

2250
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,159
injustice

2251
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:05,920
now i know this seems confrontational

2252
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,199
you guys are probably thinking [ __ ] i

2253
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:08,400
don't know if i could say that to people

2254
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,560
but

2255
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,000
i'm telling you this is the most

2256
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,679
satisfying thing that you can say to

2257
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:14,960
somebody

2258
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:17,760
because it's effective because that is

2259
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,040
the most effective thing that you can

2260
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,719
say to somebody

2261
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:22,880
and again this has been applied i mean

2262
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,400
we've got a very keen student in the

2263
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,000
back here hudson do you want to tell

2264
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,440
people what kind of reactions you've had

2265
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,719
or if you've had any negative

2266
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:29,440
interactions

2267
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,080
yes at first i was really worried about

2268
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:33,679
it about this whole approach

2269
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:36,159
and paul was like no we gotta try it you

2270
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:37,040
gotta try it

2271
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,120
and then i went up to people who were

2272
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,120
twice my size hold up hold up

2273
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,719
start from the start when you didn't

2274
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,400
want to do this you thought that this

2275
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,400
was too aggressive

2276
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,920
yeah i thought it was way too aggressive

2277
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:49,760
i got brainwashed by the vegan movement

2278
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,239
and thought

2279
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,199
that it's the wrong approach and anyway

2280
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:53,920
i

2281
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,400
recently tried out this approach being

2282
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,120
direct

2283
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,840
and what i found is people have so much

2284
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,320
more

2285
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,080
respect for me because i don't come

2286
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:04,080
across as some politician

2287
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,560
trying to sell them something and i

2288
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,520
found it's worked

2289
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,560
so much better because people recognize

2290
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,560
that we're not calling them hypocrites

2291
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,159
because we don't like them

2292
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:15,199
we're doing it because we don't like

2293
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:16,800
animal abuse and we're against the

2294
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,840
torture of animals

2295
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,719
that's a big point unless you have an

2296
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,080
ego issue

2297
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,080
this shouldn't be seen as malicious by

2298
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,679
the person you're speaking to

2299
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,120
unless you have an ego issue and you

2300
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,400
just want to be right all the time and

2301
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,080
you're trying to own people and

2302
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,440
that's the only reason why you're doing

2303
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,600
activism then people may respond

2304
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,880
negatively to you

2305
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,239
but what they pick up on is that your

2306
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:37,840
heart is in the right place when you say

2307
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:39,120
this stuff you're not saying this stuff

2308
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,840
for any other reason

2309
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,280
you only know this to be true if you

2310
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,280
apply it

2311
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,719
no matter what i say no matter what

2312
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:49,440
hudson just said you need to apply this

2313
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,120
put aside everything you've learned

2314
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,960
about outreach about everything you've

2315
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,520
learned about

2316
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,639
animal rights activism and just apply

2317
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:57,120
this

2318
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,120
not just today but for the following

2319
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,400
cubes that occur

2320
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,280
after today keep doing this and see what

2321
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,520
results you have

2322
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,840
because again this is the reason why you

2323
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,639
went vegan

2324
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,080
because you don't want to be a hypocrite

2325
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,920
you don't want to be an animal abuser

2326
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,440
and someone called you out on your

2327
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,560
hypocrisy

2328
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,000
if it wasn't someone else it was

2329
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,360
yourself that made this distinction

2330
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,600
oh

2331
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,719
i know it's crazy but apparently i need

2332
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:27,280
to make

2333
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,320
this distinction for people when i say

2334
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,360
holding non-vegans accountable

2335
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:37,760
i don't mean forcing people to go vegan

2336
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,760
you can't hold people accountable in the

2337
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:41,840
true sense of the word

2338
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,520
because people have to hold themselves

2339
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,360
accountable in the end

2340
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,760
it has to be a choice that comes from

2341
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,199
them

2342
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,760
when i say holding people accountable

2343
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,719
it's

2344
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:55,280
to the greatest extent that we can

2345
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:57,120
possibly do so

2346
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:01,040
through verbal interaction

2347
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,520
okay i didn't think i needed to clarify

2348
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,639
that but i've been getting comments and

2349
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,159
dms from people

2350
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:08,719
saying you can't force anyone to be

2351
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:10,000
vegan this holding non-vegans

2352
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,199
accountable approach

2353
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,760
is off base because people can only hold

2354
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:15,040
themselves accountable

2355
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,719
well this approach puts people in the

2356
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:19,199
best

2357
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:23,199
position to hold themselves accountable

2358
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,920
and that's the truth does this make

2359
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,679
sense to everybody

2360
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:30,800
so thanks for the uh comments about the

2361
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,840
audio there

2362
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,199
i'm doing my best here with the

2363
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,120
technical end of things

2364
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,560
but let's just go back doing this

2365
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,560
and see what results you have because

2366
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,000
again this is the reason why you went

2367
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,440
vegan because you don't want to be a

2368
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:47,040
hypocrite you don't want to be an animal

2369
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:47,840
abuser

2370
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,360
and someone called you out on your

2371
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:51,760
hypocrisy if it wasn't someone else it

2372
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:52,480
was yourself

2373
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:56,080
that made this distinction

2374
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,239
does this make sense to everybody are

2375
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:00,880
you feeling this

2376
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,840
all right now i'm going to take

2377
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,120
questions your hand went up lightning

2378
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,199
fast i got to respect that

2379
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:10,239
quickly what's your opinion on joaquin

2380
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:12,400
phoenix's oscar speech on the long

2381
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,719
reaching effectiveness of that

2382
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:17,120
i loved it but it's i wouldn't have said

2383
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,480
exactly what he said

2384
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,920
but i love the fact that he used his

2385
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:21,920
platform to talk about what happens in

2386
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,600
the dairy industry

2387
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,960
i didn't like how he conflated it with

2388
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,679
love and compassion so much because i

2389
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:30,960
don't think you need to love animals to

2390
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,320
not stab them to death you don't need to

2391
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:33,679
love black people to know that they

2392
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:35,280
deserve their rights

2393
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,880
you don't need to love any being to know

2394
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,600
that they deserve their rights

2395
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,000
it's not the perfect message but i still

2396
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,360
think it was great that he did that i

2397
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,560
also want to point out

2398
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,719
that joaquin phoenix said that meat and

2399
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:48,480
dairy is the third leading

2400
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,679
cause of environmental destruction or

2401
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:52,800
climate crisis

2402
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,639
but didn't we hear in conspiracy that it

2403
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,719
was the leading cause

2404
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,040
so why the [ __ ] are we even doing this

2405
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,000
why are we even promoting

2406
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,679
environmentalism and trying to use

2407
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,040
environmental facts when it keeps

2408
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,639
changing on us

2409
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:07,440
when it comes to these things studies

2410
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,199
can come back

2411
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,920
to us that may prove us wrong on the

2412
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,800
environment tip

2413
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,840
in fact i've seen it proven that

2414
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,320
you can be environmentally way more

2415
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,560
better off as a non-vegan

2416
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,600
than a vegan in many circumstances if

2417
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,520
you live in a rural area

2418
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,920
you're a minimalist and you fish from

2419
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,000
your kayak

2420
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,920
you're way more environmentally friendly

2421
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,600
than a person who lives in new york

2422
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,440
procreates

2423
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,639
eats processed foods so environmentally

2424
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:41,280
this is not a surefire argument

2425
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,600
this really isn't and i just want to say

2426
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:44,960
from the health point of view can also

2427
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,080
be justified

2428
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:48,480
you can eat a piece of cheese or you can

2429
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,119
eat a

2430
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:52,239
salmon once a week and justify that from

2431
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,080
a health perspective because you just

2432
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:54,719
bounce back

2433
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,239
very easily from a health point of view

2434
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:58,639
you can feel better pretty quickly

2435
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:00,320
so there's no point of even arguing the

2436
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,600
health and the environment for those

2437
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,440
reasons

2438
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:08,880
next question even if that were true

2439
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,040
reply like because i found that to be

2440
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,719
quite good and when you say

2441
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,400
even if that were true how do you

2442
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,040
justify this do you ever use that at all

2443
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,800
i do i've been using that recently

2444
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,239
people say i think there's bigger issues

2445
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:21,199
in the world

2446
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,920
right human issues are more important

2447
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,600
well even if there are bigger issues in

2448
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,040
the world which we actually know that

2449
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,400
this is the biggest issue

2450
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,480
with the health and environment the only

2451
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:31,920
reason why we're talking about it is

2452
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:33,280
because animal

2453
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,239
rights is such an issue that it's

2454
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:38,560
impacted our environment

2455
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,880
it's become that big of an issue that it

2456
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,239
impacts our environment

2457
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,719
and it impacts human health to the

2458
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:47,520
extent that it does

2459
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,080
but we can give them that still and say

2460
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,679
even if there are bigger issues what

2461
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:55,440
justifies you doing this to them

2462
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:58,960
any other questions yes i've found on

2463
01:36:58,960 --> 01:36:59,600
the internet

2464
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,320
so you put something up about veganism a

2465
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,760
lot of people just put like you know

2466
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,199
means to take the piss out of the

2467
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:06,800
veganism people sort of just go

2468
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,960
straight to that and they won't listen

2469
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,400
to you after that like

2470
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,239
so they take the piss out of what you're

2471
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:14,320
trying to do and then you just can't get

2472
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,159
through to them at all because they're

2473
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:19,520
so fixated on taking the piss out of us

2474
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,280
how would you get through take the piss

2475
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,760
out of them

2476
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,600
roast them in return they're the ones

2477
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,520
that are supposed to be roasted

2478
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,800
yeah but if they're just trolling

2479
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,960
they're not reachable but

2480
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,639
my simple response would be to roast

2481
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,000
them back but sometimes

2482
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,560
it's just like people are more drawn to

2483
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:37,920
a picture or something because the

2484
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,320
bulk amount of people can just you know

2485
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,920
gang up on you like that and

2486
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,080
it makes you feel like you know you

2487
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,520
should just stop talking like it's sort

2488
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,159
of hard

2489
01:37:46,159 --> 01:37:48,639
it feels like you're trapped in that

2490
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:49,440
position where

2491
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,480
you know like there's no actual response

2492
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:52,960
that's

2493
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,119
worth and then it just makes you think

2494
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,719
oh you know what i'm doing

2495
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,400
am i actually doing the right thing is

2496
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,239
it worth me spending my time doing this

2497
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:02,000
you're definitely doing the right thing

2498
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,600
when you speak up for the animals it's

2499
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,520
always a good idea it's always

2500
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:07,679
worth doing i think your question is is

2501
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:09,119
it effective to be doing that

2502
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:11,840
is that what you're asking yeah so i

2503
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,480
don't know

2504
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,920
like with regards to the comments that

2505
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:16,239
coming in on your facebook or instagram

2506
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:17,600
i don't know if those individuals are

2507
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,040
going to go vegan but it may be more

2508
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,040
about who's reading it

2509
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,320
you know what i'm saying the imprint

2510
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,159
that you leave on those individuals

2511
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:26,320
it's important that you only focus on

2512
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,360
what you're saying

2513
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,679
and how you advocate for the animals so

2514
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:31,600
that if anybody ever does stumble across

2515
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:32,719
the comment thread

2516
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:35,360
that they read the right thing they hear

2517
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,880
what they're supposed to hear from

2518
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,480
you know what i'm trying to get at yeah

2519
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,040
yeah and that's the best you can do

2520
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,639
whether you should be doing this with

2521
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:44,480
those individuals i don't know because

2522
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,840
you'd have to give me more specific

2523
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,199
examples about what they're saying and

2524
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,239
how they're saying it

2525
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:50,159
but if they're dropping memes about

2526
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:53,199
eating meat and how tasty bacon is

2527
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:54,639
i've actually found that roasting those

2528
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:56,880
people can be pretty effective

2529
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,639
don't waste too much energy on it you

2530
01:38:58,639 --> 01:38:59,920
may want to block them after a certain

2531
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,679
point once you've made your point

2532
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,320
for people to read so you may want to

2533
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,400
manage it that way on social media

2534
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,400
but as long as you say the correct thing

2535
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,440
you're in the right

2536
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,960
space yes um paul

2537
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,560
um i just wrote down this thing that i

2538
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,679
was going to say when you were talking

2539
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,119
about the blood on your hand

2540
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:20,000
on their hands so i found it actually

2541
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,760
harder to speak to people that i know

2542
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,840
personally that love animals

2543
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,080
um also they love animals they actually

2544
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,760
i've lost four people that i've known

2545
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,920
for a long time because they

2546
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,440
they seem to think that my message is

2547
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,760
hateful so people who have tried to

2548
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,719
break down the barriers

2549
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,040
um around animals in agriculture they

2550
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,639
reject any notion

2551
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,119
of even

2552
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:44,239
so when my compassion for the animals

2553
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:44,880
involved

2554
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,719
into more what you would call aggression

2555
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:49,280
and like passionate speaking

2556
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:52,560
and ask why they can ignore those

2557
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,840
animals quite um and can be hateful

2558
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,560
how do we get people to abandon a

2559
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,000
lifetime of adoption and

2560
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,719
views around farm animals particularly

2561
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,800
as people seem to not acknowledge their

2562
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,800
sentience or even have any regard for

2563
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:07,760
them as if

2564
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,679
they're not relevant other than as a

2565
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:11,520
commodity so i've found that

2566
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,840
by trying to get people to engage their

2567
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,119
compassion or

2568
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:18,719
even their sense of justice around

2569
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,239
animals

2570
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:24,080
yeah and you're the only one who's

2571
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,920
making them visible

2572
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,719
or attempting to at this point yes like

2573
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:29,280
they

2574
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,639
know that that you know advertising

2575
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:34,840
exists but they actually don't

2576
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,840
connect

2577
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,320
they have to disconnect in order to

2578
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,080
sleep at night

2579
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,800
and what you represent is a mirror

2580
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,080
you're a mirror

2581
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:48,400
and when they call you hateful you are

2582
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,000
actually hateful but not to them you're

2583
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,520
hateful to their actions they're

2584
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:52,880
the abuse that's occurring to the

2585
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,880
animals so don't again don't let people

2586
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,400
shame you out of these things

2587
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,440
yes you are hateful own it you are

2588
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,159
hateful

2589
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:01,520
you do hate what they're doing to

2590
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,119
animals that's why you're speaking up

2591
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,800
and that's why you're passionate

2592
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,320
you're not just passionate this is an

2593
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:07,920
art we're talking about you're not just

2594
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,040
passionate about this

2595
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,679
this is an injustice and you are angry

2596
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:12,960
you hate the fact that

2597
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,440
your friends people you love are so

2598
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,480
willing

2599
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,679
to make excuses for something so

2600
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:22,719
unbelievably unjustifiable

2601
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:24,560
right that's what you hate the fact that

2602
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:25,760
they're

2603
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,560
yeah but like even the people that you

2604
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,920
outreach to like actually

2605
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,040
trying to make them feel something

2606
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:36,320
though because it could be on their

2607
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,800
radar

2608
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,520
what from what you've told me i actually

2609
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,040
think that they do have it on their

2610
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,800
radar because that's why they're trying

2611
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,480
to disconnect and call you hateful

2612
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,840
things when they say things that are

2613
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,840
inaccurate and irrational it's a sign

2614
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:50,719
that they do have

2615
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,880
guilt and guilt is a sign of them caring

2616
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:53,840
about the subject

2617
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:56,159
it's just so far buried down there

2618
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,440
because that's where it needs to be for

2619
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,840
them to sleep at

2620
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:02,159
do you understand these people do care

2621
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:03,280
about this issue

2622
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,440
you're just living proof of it being

2623
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,280
made into action and having your

2624
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:09,679
your actions aligned with your morals

2625
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:11,280
and you represent

2626
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,119
something to them that makes them feel

2627
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:14,960
inadequate and they should [ __ ] feel

2628
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,360
that way

2629
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,800
you do hate what they're doing to the

2630
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,639
animals let them know that

2631
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:21,840
that you don't respect what they're

2632
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,239
doing to the animals and there's no way

2633
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:25,920
that they can justify it keep asking

2634
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,600
them how do you justify this

2635
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,360
even if you think that a cow doesn't

2636
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,040
feel the same way as a dog

2637
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,719
or the same way more importantly don't

2638
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:34,560
use a dog as an example use them

2639
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,159
how would you feel if you're in a cow's

2640
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,560
position what crime has a cow committed

2641
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,679
other than being born non-human there's

2642
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:43,440
no way they can justify so asking these

2643
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,080
basic questions usually will lead you

2644
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:50,560
to having them face the facts and

2645
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,400
a vegan well they may temporarily but if

2646
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,600
that's the reason i don't talk to you

2647
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,159
anymore

2648
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,320
for someone who is a concerned citizen

2649
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,400
speaking up against injustice

2650
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,719
then they're not really your friend are

2651
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:03,520
they

2652
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,760
friends don't abandon friends over

2653
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,280
something so

2654
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:10,480
obviously righteous like that even if

2655
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,159
they're the perpetrator again they can't

2656
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:13,600
justify it

2657
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,040
a real friend would be like you know

2658
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,600
what i respect the fact that you called

2659
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,199
me out and there's nothing i can say

2660
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:21,360
like i am hypocrite and i am an animal

2661
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:22,719
abuser

2662
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,400
or even if they don't admit to that they

2663
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,840
would at least keep you in their lives

2664
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,199
if they respected the fact that you're

2665
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:28,560
speaking up against this

2666
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,840
and then it's up to you how long you

2667
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,800
keep them in your lives

2668
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:39,840
does that help yeah thanks a lot cool

2669
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:50,639
[Music]

2670
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:53,679
stop share so there it is

2671
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:56,239
that was the holding non-vegans

2672
01:43:56,239 --> 01:44:00,560
accountable 2.0 from perth australia

2673
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:02,880
that was the second stop on the

2674
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,320
australian leg

2675
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,520
of the world tour that we embarked on

2676
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:11,040
in february which got

2677
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:14,800
put to an end due to the coronavirus

2678
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,840
so i will take questions and i will also

2679
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,840
start using this presentation with the

2680
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,520
slides to break down this whole thing

2681
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:22,639
once over

2682
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:24,239
just to reiterate all the points that

2683
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:26,719
were made

2684
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,360
it is good to feel bad about something

2685
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:36,560
that is bad simple

2686
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:41,440
i love simplicity and effectiveness

2687
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:44,719
the simpler the better

2688
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,880
in terms of effectiveness it has to have

2689
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,239
that effectiveness there but the

2690
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:51,600
simplicity i just love that so much

2691
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,840
okay

2692
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:59,920
so i'm gonna get these slides downloaded

2693
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,639
but if you guys have any questions lace

2694
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:05,920
me up in the comments

2695
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,560
okay where is this

2696
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,679
here we are

2697
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,159
all right so i'm going to go over

2698
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:24,000
everything once more just to reiterate

2699
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,520
all these points and make sure you guys

2700
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,199
fully understand them

2701
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:30,560
there was a complaint about my speaking

2702
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,440
voice

2703
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:33,520
how is the audio coming through let me

2704
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,679
know

2705
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:45,840
oh

2706
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:49,280
nope this isn't it

2707
01:45:52,320 --> 01:46:13,840
this is it um

2708
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:18,880
um okay so question by carlo hi paul

2709
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,719
once you understand that the person

2710
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:22,480
you are talking to is not going to be

2711
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,239
interested in the topic and continues

2712
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:26,719
justifying animal abuse

2713
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,239
what do you say to them before going

2714
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:31,520
away all these examples you saw

2715
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,440
and everything that we said in the

2716
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,679
approach applies to these individuals

2717
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:38,800
the only difference is that

2718
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,800
at some i'm assuming that these people

2719
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,520
probably at a cube of truth probably

2720
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,600
won't even stop but if they do stop

2721
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,280
and you're talking to them at some point

2722
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,040
it could be really powerful for you to

2723
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:54,719
just end the discussion

2724
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,920
with that that uh statement that was

2725
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,600
made at the end of the interaction you

2726
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,040
saw examples from hudson and jacob

2727
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,480
um just know that for as long as you

2728
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,719
remain non-vegan these animals will be

2729
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:10,320
tortured and abused

2730
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,760
because of you and

2731
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,960
just decide what side of history

2732
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,800
so i'll i'll leave this with you to

2733
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,000
think about but

2734
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,880
you ultimately will need to decide which

2735
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,080
side of history

2736
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,320
you want to stand on something powerful

2737
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,840
like that a statement like that is all

2738
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,040
you can really do

2739
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,000
with those individuals and i i just want

2740
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,440
to say that it's important that you

2741
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,280
respect your time

2742
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,440
as an activist and that you're not

2743
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,440
wasting your breath on people so

2744
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:42,000
it's very powerful to say to the

2745
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,520
individual

2746
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,760
that you would like to carry on your

2747
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,360
work with those who are

2748
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:49,280
like you'd like to move on you know so

2749
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,880
ending the discussion and moving on

2750
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,320
after you make that statement

2751
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,679
is super powerful and that's what you

2752
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:56,000
should do

2753
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:05,679
audio is fine good thank you guys

2754
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:07,280
i've got the slide ready i'm just going

2755
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,480
to read through your comments and see if

2756
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:19,840
there's any questions

2757
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:24,639
david's saying i would only say i

2758
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:27,119
wouldn't mind if an animal killed me

2759
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:29,600
but i would say i would eat you would

2760
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,040
say that you would eat a human

2761
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:34,080
okay david you uh

2762
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,480
you sound a bit confused buddy i don't

2763
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,000
think you would be okay with an animal

2764
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,920
eating you if you had a choice

2765
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:43,199
and you have a choice not to eat animals

2766
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:46,639
so you're the oppressor and the power is

2767
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:48,639
in your hands

2768
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:51,199
to end the suffering and abuse and

2769
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:52,560
torture

2770
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,400
that you would inflict on these animals

2771
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,400
otherwise if you choose

2772
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:59,199
to continue to be a non-vegan human

2773
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,159
supremacist

2774
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,000
because that's what non-vegans are human

2775
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,360
supremacists

2776
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,639
and you are subscribing to this

2777
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:09,119
death cult you're subscribing to this

2778
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,760
idea that animals should be reduced

2779
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,880
to a sandwich through violent

2780
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,679
beheadings and enslavement and torture

2781
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,880
david says it's an excuse but i'm

2782
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,639
addicted

2783
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:29,760
addiction isn't a justification

2784
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,040
so let's hope that david gets the

2785
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:34,000
message here and does actually connect

2786
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,560
his actions to his words and ends his

2787
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,159
hypocrisy for real

2788
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:39,520
but let's move on to your other

2789
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,440
questions here guys

2790
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,040
can you say something about infighting

2791
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,560
between vegans

2792
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:47,440
and outreach organizations i hate it and

2793
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:49,440
how to stop this

2794
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,920
welcome to the animal rights movement if

2795
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,840
you know how i can stop this i'd like to

2796
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:56,080
know

2797
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:59,199
um vegans are the biggest threat to the

2798
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:00,320
animal rights movement

2799
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,080
i've been saying this for a while i

2800
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:03,440
learned this the hard way

2801
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,480
gary told me told everyone

2802
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:08,880
and i didn't think it was necessarily

2803
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,280
true either at first but i've come to

2804
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:11,840
learn this

2805
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:14,960
very much so humans

2806
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:18,639
what can i say it's terrible

2807
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:21,679
but one thing that gives me optimism and

2808
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:22,080
hope

2809
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:25,199
is that there are plenty of us out there

2810
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:27,119
who vibrate on this frequency and that's

2811
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:28,560
all we need to do to continue moving

2812
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,280
forward is

2813
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:33,040
us supporting us so when i read your

2814
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:33,760
comments

2815
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,159
supporting av supporting me and asal and

2816
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:36,800
the whole av

2817
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:39,280
team we appreciate it so much because it

2818
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:40,080
means that

2819
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,800
we are working together we do have unity

2820
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,400
between those who vibrate on this

2821
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,800
frequency and that's important

2822
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:49,440
where can you get the new outreach cards

2823
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:52,080
from your organizer

2824
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,480
if there's no organizer in your city go

2825
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:55,679
over to our

2826
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:58,000
website and go to the join section and

2827
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,599
apply to become an organizer

2828
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:02,719
so that you can launch a cube of truth a

2829
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:05,119
chapter in your city where cuba truth

2830
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:07,840
events operate

2831
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,000
lots of questions coming through

2832
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,520
how do i respond to people that say they

2833
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:20,960
can't go vegan because of

2834
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,000
medical advice point them to all of the

2835
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,800
medical advice that

2836
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,040
that says otherwise we have empirical

2837
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:30,320
data that shows

2838
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,480
that it's perfectly adequate for all

2839
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,000
human beings to be on a plant-based

2840
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,280
diet point them to the

2841
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:40,320
evidence there's only one

2842
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,480
source of scientific data there's only

2843
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,320
one database

2844
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:48,400
okay so michael greger is

2845
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:51,119
a great person to look into because he

2846
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:52,480
breaks down the data

2847
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:54,400
so nutritionfacts.com but the thing i

2848
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,480
just want nutritionfacts.org is the

2849
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,360
website there

2850
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:58,960
but i just want to say that this person

2851
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,320
saying this most likely woody

2852
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,679
is using this as an excuse to not go

2853
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:06,480
vegan

2854
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:10,000
if they're truly wanting to end

2855
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,920
the abuse that they cause to animals the

2856
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,760
needless suffering or in their case they

2857
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,719
think it's

2858
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:16,400
required but if they really want to end

2859
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,239
it then they'll look into it

2860
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:20,000
and they'll do their very damnedest to

2861
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,719
make it happen to to end it

2862
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:24,880
and so if you are talking to someone

2863
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,960
who's truly trying to end it

2864
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:28,480
then just give them that information

2865
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,400
that should be enough but usually it

2866
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,080
comes back to accountability

2867
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:33,840
in those cases usually people are just

2868
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:45,840
using that as an excuse

2869
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:48,320
is it cruel to raise kids non-vegan it's

2870
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:49,920
cruel to the animals

2871
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,840
yeah and it is cruel to humans on some

2872
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,280
level but it's

2873
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,199
not even comparable to what we do to the

2874
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,880
animals so i'm not even going to say

2875
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,719
it's cruel to the humans

2876
01:52:58,719 --> 01:53:03,040
um so

2877
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,719
what was the other part of that question

2878
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:10,000
um saying this as a mother

2879
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,560
it's cruel to the animals and you're

2880
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:13,360
robbing

2881
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,040
children and you're robbing children

2882
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,480
over there you're making them confused

2883
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:17,520
and you're robbing them off

2884
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:18,880
i mean every vegan will say they wish

2885
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,719
they were vegan since birth so

2886
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:22,400
you're robbing them of that opportunity

2887
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,840
to do the right thing

2888
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,199
when kids are just doing what their

2889
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:29,040
parents tell them to do so

2890
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,599
when non-vegans say don't force this on

2891
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:32,719
your children they're forcing

2892
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:35,119
non-veganism on their children

2893
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:37,440
parenting is forcing that's what

2894
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,040
parenting is

2895
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:40,560
they do what their parents tell them to

2896
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:44,159
do up until they're 18.

2897
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:47,840
so it's if you're gonna have to choose a

2898
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:48,560
diet for them

2899
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,000
why wouldn't you choose the one that

2900
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,840
doesn't involve bloodshed

2901
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,440
abuse torture suffering when it's

2902
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,599
needless

2903
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,960
that's my answer to that question

2904
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:07,360
much love jeanette appreciate your

2905
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:09,840
comment

2906
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,639
um

2907
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,760
how do you convince religious people or

2908
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,360
anyone who is used to seeing animal

2909
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:17,840
abuse

2910
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:20,239
since young to feel something for the

2911
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:21,599
animals that's two different questions

2912
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:22,960
there

2913
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:25,920
religious people

2914
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,080
it's no different this whole approach is

2915
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:30,560
no different if people say i believe god

2916
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:33,199
said it's okay

2917
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:37,760
classic gary quote if god says this is

2918
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:41,280
okay then what does the devil do

2919
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,800
just you're not going to get through to

2920
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,480
most religious people you just need to

2921
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:49,760
ask them these really tough questions

2922
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,199
and treat them no different to anyone

2923
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:52,480
else with the approach that we're giving

2924
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,719
you

2925
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,440
okay um and that second question i think

2926
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,320
i've already answered

2927
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:05,520
generally all right guys um

2928
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,760
there are other questions here and if

2929
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,280
you're not going to stay on this stream

2930
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,880
you can watch this back when this video

2931
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,639
goes up and i will respond to your

2932
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:14,320
question at some point but i'm now going

2933
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,800
to get into the slides

2934
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:20,480
in the interest of time management

2935
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:32,239
right i'm gonna share this and i'm just

2936
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:33,679
gonna go through

2937
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:36,239
each of the points that were raised in

2938
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:39,440
that workshop for you guys

2939
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:46,719

2941
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:03,040

01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:30,239
i'm about to go through

2948
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:40,320
i just need one of you guys to confirm

2949
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,080

2951
01:56:48,580 --> 01:56:51,850
[Music]

okay

2953
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,080
all good cool thanks guys all right so

2954
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,280
let's get into it so

2955
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,760
this is our outreach workshop in slides

2956
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:08,560
you might see

2957
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,960
organizers in your city or town and if

2958
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:12,960
you are an organizer or you become an

2959
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:13,920
organizer

2960
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,599
your organizer may run through a

2961
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:17,360
workshop with you in your city

2962
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:19,280
and they'll use these slides and these

2963
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,280
slides may be updated from time to time

2964
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:25,440
but right now this is our most updated

2965
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:28,639
outreach workshop in slide format so

2966
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:29,760
let's

2967
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:32,880
let's go so we start with this important

2968
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,480
question

2969
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,639
what even is veganism if you ask a group

2970
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:38,320
of people what it means to be vegan you

2971
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,239
most likely will get multiple versions

2972
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:42,080
of what they believe it to be

2973
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,679
veganism has nothing to do with our

2974
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:45,840
health the environment human rights or

2975
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,760
affection towards animals

2976
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:49,679
it is not about justice for non-human

2977
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:51,199
animal rights

2978
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:54,639
vegan equals anti-animal abuse

2979
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:56,480
now i'm not going to make any extra

2980
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:57,920
points here unless they naturally come

2981
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,040
to me

2982
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:01,119
but if you guys in the comments want to

2983
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:02,239
make any points

2984
01:58:02,239 --> 01:58:05,280
or any questions about this slide be as

2985
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:06,159
quick as you can

2986
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:08,639
while this slides up i'm gonna wait two

2987
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:09,360
minutes

2988
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:12,480
between each slide so that if there's

2989
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,920
anything specifically

2990
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,520
that you would like me to address

2991
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,679
regarding the points on each slide

2992
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:20,560
i'll address them as we go so two

2993
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,840
minutes starting now i'm going to start

2994
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:25,199
my stopwatch on my phone

2995
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:27,440
you know we have to start with the

2996
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,679
definition of veganism before we even

2997
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:32,239
talk about activism

2998
01:58:32,239 --> 01:58:35,199
so two minutes if anyone wants to

2999
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:38,719
discuss anything here let me know

3000
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:43,119
it's two minutes too long maybe i should

3001
01:58:43,119 --> 01:58:49,840
just do one minute

3002
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:00,159
yeah common sense and self-explanatory

3003
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:01,520
this slide all right

3004
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,639
well i'm i'm gonna reduce that to one

3005
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:06,239
minute so we've got 30 seconds

3006
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:11,040
to go i think one minute is plenty

3007
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,480
i don't have anything i'd like to add to

3008
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,080
this

3009
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:17,840
it's very straightforward like you said

3010
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:23,679
so 10 seconds i'm assuming there's no

3011
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:26,400
questions here

3012
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:28,239
i'm an admin of the malaysian vegan

3013
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:30,080
facebook group one question we ask

3014
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,080
people who request to join is what

3015
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:34,080
veganism means to them most of them say

3016
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,040
it's kindness

3017
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:38,000
and great health

3018
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:41,199
wow yeah that's just typical isn't it

3019
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:42,800
it's a very common thing in the animal

3020
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,719
rights movement

3021
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:45,920
and the other thing i want to point out

3022
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,679
is you know when you ask what the

3023
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:49,360
benefit is

3024
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:51,440
most people say health or the

3025
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:52,560
environment

3026
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,400
which just goes to prove we don't need

3027
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,159
to talk about health and the environment

3028
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:56,960
with people and

3029
01:59:56,960 --> 01:59:59,040
talk about them as benefits and act like

3030
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:00,800
that's what animal rights is all about

3031
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:02,560
people already know about those things

3032
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,400
what they really need to hear

3033
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:06,480
is accountability for what they're doing

3034
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:08,239
to the animals that's it

3035
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:13,840
moving on

3036
02:00:19,920 --> 02:00:21,599
all right so what is animal rights

3037
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:23,360
activism activism is speaking up for the

3038
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:24,719
victims in the same way that you would

3039
02:00:24,719 --> 02:00:26,560
want to be spoken up for if you were in

3040
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,480
their position

3041
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,719
it is being a medium of truth and

3042
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:33,280
enacting change by prioritizing the

3043
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,000
victims and not the oppressors

3044
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,199
one minute starting now

3045
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:42,560
i don't have anything to add to this

3046
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,880
either

3047
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,280
this might even change to 30 seconds

3048
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:54,560
because i don't want to drag this out

3049
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:56,080
for people watching this back i want

3050
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:56,800
this to be

3051
02:00:56,800 --> 02:01:00,159
as succinct as possible but i just want

3052
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:01,679
to make sure i cover any

3053
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:03,920
questions or points that might come up i

3054
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:04,719
just want to be as

3055
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:06,639
thorough as possible in addressing this

3056
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:08,719
i think i might reduce

3057
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:10,560
the time that i put aside for you guys

3058
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,400
to 30 seconds in fact

3059
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:23,840
instead of a minute

3060
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:34,880
all right let's move on yeah i'm going

3061
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:36,560
to reduce this down to 30 seconds

3062
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,880
between slides to allow you guys to jump

3063
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:39,920
in if you want

3064
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:44,560
me to discuss anything more specifically

3065
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:51,840
crystal clear says carlo great

3066
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,960
don't try to be a communications guru

3067
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:56,880
this goes back to the sales thing almost

3068
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:59,199
um always remember that you will never

3069
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:00,960
have 100

3070
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:02,960
success rate within animal rights

3071
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,239
outreach

3072
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:06,080
there is no magic set of words to use

3073
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:07,760
during outreach that will make someone

3074
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:08,880
go vegan

3075
02:02:08,880 --> 02:02:10,639
if they're ready they'll listen if

3076
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:13,280
they're not ready they won't

3077
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,520
with the context provided your function

3078
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,520
as an activist is to hold the individual

3079
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:18,560
you're speaking with

3080
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,560
accountable for the animal abuse they

3081
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:22,880
support and to make them aware of the

3082
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:23,840
consequences

3083
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:33,840
of their choices 30 seconds

3084
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:40,239
is too quick 30 seconds

3085
02:02:42,159 --> 02:02:46,080
if it's too quick uh

3086
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:49,599
how about we just do a compromise make

3087
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:52,639
it 45 seconds

3088
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:56,000
i just don't want it to get too slow for

3089
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:01,840
those watching this back

3090
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:15,840
you know

3091
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:19,360
okay

3092
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,360
cool all right so let's move on we've

3093
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:29,840
done 45 seconds there

3094
02:03:30,159 --> 02:03:33,360
30 david's voting 30.

3095
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:35,360
all right let's move on so your goal

3096
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:37,040
should not be to plant seeds animal

3097
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:37,440
rights

3098
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,599
outreach is not verbal leafleting i'm

3099
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:41,280
going to repeat that

3100
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:44,400
standing in front of a non-vegan and

3101
02:03:44,400 --> 02:03:46,639
spitting all these little factoids out

3102
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:48,079
at them

3103
02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:50,800
is not activism and i heard someone say

3104
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,560
planting seeds in the comments i mean i

3105
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:54,159
know planting seeds is like a common

3106
02:03:54,159 --> 02:03:55,920
term used in the animal rights movement

3107
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,040
specifically

3108
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,760
but i guess we're doing that but it's

3109
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:00,560
not

3110
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:02,560
in the same way that people think of

3111
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:04,159
planting seeds that's not what we're

3112
02:04:04,159 --> 02:04:05,599
doing here

3113
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:08,840
animal rights outreach is not verbal

3114
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:10,560
leafleting

3115
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:13,040
if the goal were to provide information

3116
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:13,920
we would hand out

3117
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:16,800
leaflets and magazines and if that was

3118
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,480
all that people needed to go out to go

3119
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:21,040
vegan then

3120
02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:22,960
the information is already out there so

3121
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:24,400
it's not necessarily about the

3122
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:25,920
information

3123
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,679
the function of outreach is to make

3124
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:29,440
people understand the consequences of

3125
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:30,880
their choices by holding them

3126
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:31,840
accountable

3127
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:34,960
and centering the interaction on what

3128
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,960
they can personally do about the animal

3129
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:37,520
of the use

3130
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:41,599
on an individual level

3131
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,440
45 seconds

3132
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:49,440
is there anything here that you guys

3133
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:52,320
have any questions about i don't

3134
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:53,599
apologize

3135
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:57,920
um you know don't apologize this is

3136
02:04:57,920 --> 02:04:59,599
a learning process i'm taking you guys

3137
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:01,520
on i've learned this stuff and i'm just

3138
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:02,639
teaching you guys what i've learned and

3139
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:06,320
what we've learned together actually

3140
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,560
so

3141
02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:13,040
not verbal leafleting is the biggest

3142
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:15,760
part of this slide

3143
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:18,880
no verbal leafleting

3144
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,520
that's just cancer in the animal rights

3145
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:23,119
movement i've seen it so many times i've

3146
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:24,960
done it myself it gets you nowhere and

3147
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,480
it makes this message

3148
02:05:26,480 --> 02:05:29,199
seem even more of a like a mockery to

3149
02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:29,679
people

3150
02:05:29,679 --> 02:05:32,320
like it's it takes it takes it down a

3151
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:35,040
notch to then being taken less seriously

3152
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:49,199
so all right that's 45 seconds moving on

3153
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:51,199
veganism is not love or compassion

3154
02:05:51,199 --> 02:05:52,800
veganism is about justice your

3155
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,800
likability does not determine your

3156
02:05:54,800 --> 02:05:56,159
rights

3157
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:58,880
so out i'm going to repeat that just

3158
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:00,159
because someone doesn't like you it

3159
02:06:00,159 --> 02:06:01,679
doesn't mean they have the right to take

3160
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:03,520
your rights away from you

3161
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,280
so that's why we don't need to lean into

3162
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,679
how much people like animals

3163
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:09,520
that's just the wrong way to communicate

3164
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:10,719
this message

3165
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:13,440
outreach is not about how you or anyone

3166
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:13,840
else

3167
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:16,000
feels about animals if you don't go

3168
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,840
around beating children you aren't

3169
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:20,239
instantly a compassionate individual

3170
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:22,159
refraining from injustice does not make

3171
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:24,960
you compassionate by default

3172
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:26,320
and we can see that because in the

3173
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,719
animal rights movement vegans are some

3174
02:06:28,719 --> 02:06:29,520
of the

3175
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:31,520
least compassionate people that i have

3176
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:33,040
to deal with

3177
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:36,239
veganism is a non-action it's not loving

3178
02:06:36,239 --> 02:06:41,520
it's merely the right thing to do 45

3179
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:45,840
seconds

3180
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,760
all right i'm reading your comments guys

3181
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:51,199
if there's anything you want me to

3182
02:06:51,199 --> 02:06:52,159
expand on

3183
02:06:52,159 --> 02:06:59,840
now's your time

3184
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,960
you know what i'm going to reduce this

3185
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:22,960
back down to 30 seconds

3186
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:26,400
uh and if you guys like need more time

3187
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,239
to write your comment

3188
02:07:28,239 --> 02:07:31,760
just start off with a comment

3189
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:33,199
that you can just send out real quick

3190
02:07:33,199 --> 02:07:35,040
that says i have a comment or i have

3191
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:36,239
something i want to add

3192
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:38,800
and then i will wait for you to write

3193
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,159
your longer question

3194
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:41,679
if this is too quick so i'm going to

3195
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:44,480
reduce this back to 30 seconds

3196
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:45,599
and that's what you can do if you have

3197
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:46,800
any questions but there are questions

3198
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,400
coming in now

3199
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,000
so i will answer them what does leaf

3200
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
litting mean leafleting means

3201
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
handing out pieces of information to

3202
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:55,440
people and then

3203
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:58,239
it's just like all these little factoids

3204
02:07:58,239 --> 02:07:59,199
about like

3205
02:07:59,199 --> 02:08:01,119
how old chickens are when they're

3206
02:08:01,119 --> 02:08:02,639
murdered and all these things and you

3207
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:03,199
know

3208
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:06,400
the the irony of how counterproductive

3209
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:09,840
this is is obvious to me because so many

3210
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:10,800
non-vegans

3211
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:14,000
already know about how much of a

3212
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,159
shocker the meat dairy and egg

3213
02:08:16,159 --> 02:08:17,119
industries are

3214
02:08:17,119 --> 02:08:18,480
they already know that they treat

3215
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:20,560
animals horribly they already know about

3216
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:21,119
how

3217
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:22,480
young the animals are when they're

3218
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:25,360
murdered and all these crazy statistics

3219
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:28,079
and it's very easy to find out but it

3220
02:08:28,079 --> 02:08:29,760
doesn't make people go vegan

3221
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:32,079
because knowing all these factoids is

3222
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:33,599
one thing

3223
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:35,520
and yes that might cause some people to

3224
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:37,440
go vegan i take that back i know some of

3225
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:37,840
you

3226
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:39,360
thinking well i went vegan when i looked

3227
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,360
into the dairy industry but at some

3228
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:43,040
point there was accountability for your

3229
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:45,360
actions and wanting to be

3230
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:46,960
accountable for yourself for what you're

3231
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:50,400
doing to them and yeah

3232
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:51,840
that's what it comes down to these

3233
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:53,440
factoids don't really push people

3234
02:08:53,440 --> 02:08:55,040
towards it it just puts them in a

3235
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,480
position where they just feel like they

3236
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:57,199
need to continue

3237
02:08:57,199 --> 02:08:58,719
arguing the points and all this stuff

3238
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:00,400
and it's just

3239
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:02,840
it's not it's not very effective at all

3240
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:05,840
so

3241
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,440
let's see if there's any other comments

3242
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,679
here

3243
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:15,440
ariane huge comment

3244
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,360
very well said people will forget about

3245
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:18,960
the facts anyways

3246
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:20,960
what they will remember is the guilty

3247
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,320
feeling when they hear

3248
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:24,960
that they are animal abusers so just to

3249
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,000
expand on

3250
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,199
ariane's point here and point out how

3251
02:09:29,199 --> 02:09:31,599
how true that is there's a really great

3252
02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:32,560
quote that

3253
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:34,960
everyone knows and it's just so true

3254
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,800
people don't remember what you said

3255
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:39,840
they remember how they felt when you

3256
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,679
said it

3257
02:09:41,679 --> 02:09:47,840
and that's what this is all about

3258
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:55,760
yeah veganism is about justice we can't

3259
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:57,599
point that out enough seemingly

3260
02:09:57,599 --> 02:10:01,840
so we cannot point it out enough

3261
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:03,440
all right moving on guys thanks for your

3262
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:05,040
comments i appreciate it

3263
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:06,400
i just want to make sure that i cover

3264
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:08,079
everything for you guys and i appreciate

3265
02:10:08,079 --> 02:10:09,280
you guys being a part of this live

3266
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:11,440
stream

3267
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:15,840
all right moving on

3268
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,800
this approach is pure honesty telling

3269
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:20,880
someone the truth is the most respectful

3270
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:22,960
thing you can do for them

3271
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:25,119
when you agree with every statement said

3272
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:26,639
by the bystander

3273
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:29,199
they will often lose respect for you and

3274
02:10:29,199 --> 02:10:30,719
you will lose respect

3275
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:32,880
so you will lose control of the

3276
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,079
conversation

3277
02:10:34,079 --> 02:10:35,760
they see that your desire to be

3278
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,599
validated by them is stronger than your

3279
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:38,480
desire to end

3280
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:41,520
animal cruelty thereby making a mockery

3281
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:41,760
of

3282
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:44,079
animal rights this one needs to be

3283
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:44,960
repeated

3284
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,719
they see that your desire to be

3285
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:48,960
validated by them is stronger than your

3286
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:51,440
desire to end animal cruelty

3287
02:10:51,440 --> 02:10:54,840
thereby making a mockery of animal

3288
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:56,000
rights

3289
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,920
you imagine if the primary goal of human

3290
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,760
rights activists was to be liked by the

3291
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:02,400
oppressors

3292
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:11,840
30 seconds

3293
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,840
all right that's 30 seconds i'm liking

3294
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:38,079
the 30 seconds it feels like the right

3295
02:11:38,079 --> 02:11:43,280
amount of time here moving on

3296
02:11:44,239 --> 02:11:46,000
whenever you are afraid to speak up for

3297
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,159
animals directly or if bystanders call

3298
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:49,360
you too extreme

3299
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:51,760
place yourself in the victim's position

3300
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:52,639
and

3301
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:54,320
analyze your approach from their

3302
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,000
perspective

3303
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
would you consider a respectful yet

3304
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,560
direct conversation too extreme

3305
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:03,920
if you were locked in a slaughterhouse

3306
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:05,280
and that's the thing you know we are

3307
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:07,520
being respectful here

3308
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:09,199
it's the most respect you'll ever show

3309
02:12:09,199 --> 02:12:10,639
someone because you're telling

3310
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:12,079
the truth and giving them a true

3311
02:12:12,079 --> 02:12:13,920
opportunity

3312
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:16,560
to end their hypocrisy and to stop

3313
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:19,119
abusing innocent beings

3314
02:12:19,119 --> 02:12:23,360
like a psychopath

3315
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,880
like a cold-blooded monster that's what

3316
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:27,760
these people

3317
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:31,360
are especially once they know about what

3318
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,199
is going on and they continue to do it

3319
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:35,599
right

3320
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:39,119
um i forgot to press start on the 30

3321
02:12:39,119 --> 02:12:41,119
seconds so let's just say we're up to 15

3322
02:12:41,119 --> 02:12:43,760
seconds now

3323
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:48,639
yes

3324
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:51,599
honesty is the highest form of intimacy

3325
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:53,840
this might be irritating to some but it

3326
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:55,119
may not stop us

3327
02:12:55,119 --> 02:12:58,800
from telling the truth that's beautiful

3328
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:00,480
yeah that's so true honesty is the

3329
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:03,599
highest form of intimacy

3330
02:13:03,599 --> 02:13:16,239
word all right moving on guys

3331
02:13:16,239 --> 02:13:19,520
all right so next slide

3332
02:13:19,520 --> 02:13:22,639
don't talk about health and environment

3333
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:25,360
why do we think people care about either

3334
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:27,440
most people in the streets do not care

3335
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:29,360
about their health nor the environment

3336
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:32,159
so rooting your outreach in these topics

3337
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:33,920
will marginalize the animals

3338
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:38,079
even further health and environment may

3339
02:13:38,079 --> 02:13:39,360
become have become

3340
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:42,800
exacerbated because people do not take

3341
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:46,480
animal abuse seriously

3342
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:49,119
um again i need to repeat this point

3343
02:13:49,119 --> 02:13:50,320
because this is really

3344
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:53,119
powerful to know and understand that

3345
02:13:53,119 --> 02:13:53,679
these

3346
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:55,679
crisis that we're facing that we're

3347
02:13:55,679 --> 02:13:56,719
facing

3348
02:13:56,719 --> 02:13:58,960
that we're facing with our environment

3349
02:13:58,960 --> 02:14:02,079
and our health

3350
02:14:02,079 --> 02:14:06,079
is just an indication merely a a sign

3351
02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:09,840
that's all it is of how bad animal abuse

3352
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:13,840
is on this planet

3353
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:16,960
again i was supposed to press start

3354
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:18,639
there

3355
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:21,119
um oh no i haven't finished this all

3356
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:22,719
right

3357
02:14:22,719 --> 02:14:25,360
um the last point trying to hook people

3358
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:26,159
with an approach

3359
02:14:26,159 --> 02:14:28,239
that revolves around what benefits them

3360
02:14:28,239 --> 02:14:29,599
does not

3361
02:14:29,599 --> 02:14:31,760
let me start again trying to hook people

3362
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:33,520
with an approach that revolves around

3363
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:34,239
what

3364
02:14:34,239 --> 02:14:36,639
that revolves around what benefits them

3365
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:39,040
does a disservice to the animals

3366
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,360
focus on the root cause of the issue the

3367
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:44,159
animal abuse

3368
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:47,119
i kind of stumbled through that one but

3369
02:14:47,119 --> 02:14:49,760
you get the point you can see it

3370
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,599
i'm going to start this 30 seconds if

3371
02:14:51,599 --> 02:14:53,520
you guys have anything you'd like me to

3372
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:54,000
expand

3373
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,960
on here let me know

3374
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:00,000
people say this is fake that it's not

3375
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,520
true what to say just point at the

3376
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,239
screens

3377
02:15:02,239 --> 02:15:03,840
what part of this is fake challenge them

3378
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:06,560
to go into a farm for themselves and see

3379
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:09,119
what happens

3380
02:15:09,119 --> 02:15:11,360
in a slaughterhouse specifically say

3381
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,800
because that's where all the animals end

3382
02:15:12,800 --> 02:15:13,679
up

3383
02:15:13,679 --> 02:15:15,920
right

3384
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,159
uh i

3385
02:15:21,119 --> 02:15:23,760
i feel that i don't want to be friends

3386
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:25,760
with people after giving information

3387
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:26,400
anymore

3388
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:29,199
who won't go vegan well that's the right

3389
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:30,960
position i think

3390
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:32,400
you wouldn't again when you compare this

3391
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:33,760
to any other injustice you wouldn't

3392
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:35,119
stick around and be friends with people

3393
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:35,520
who

3394
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:38,239
continue to enslave torture and murder

3395
02:15:38,239 --> 02:15:41,199
once they know better

3396
02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:45,520
if we were the victims we would not want

3397
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:47,199
our advocates to prioritize the

3398
02:15:47,199 --> 02:15:48,560
environment or

3399
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:50,880
our oppressor's health no and it would

3400
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,079
it would be a huge

3401
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:54,480
spit in your face to do that that's the

3402
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:56,000
whole point of

3403
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,880
clarifying this for you guys because the

3404
02:15:58,880 --> 02:15:59,920
victims

3405
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:01,679
deserve so much better from us to be

3406
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:03,280
advocating directly for them and they

3407
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:04,079
they do deserve

3408
02:16:04,079 --> 02:16:06,159
a direct message that's dedicated to

3409
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:08,400
them

3410
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:18,800
yes yes okay

3411
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:21,760
um what are some variable ways to start

3412
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:23,280
the conversation other than have you

3413
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:24,719
seen this type of footage before we

3414
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:26,159
don't actually ask that anymore have you

3415
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:28,079
seen this type of footage before

3416
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:30,400
we do sometimes but in this approach

3417
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:31,520
with this update

3418
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:33,040
you don't need to ask that in fact what

3419
02:16:33,040 --> 02:16:34,478
we do is we say would you like to know

3420
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:36,080
why we're here

3421
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:38,398
um so vegan mark i'm not sure if you're

3422
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:39,920
just joining the stream but we did cover

3423
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:41,200
this you might want to watch this video

3424
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:42,398
back and it will be

3425
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:43,760
available for everyone to watch back

3426
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:46,718
once i'm done and we did cover that

3427
02:16:46,718 --> 02:16:49,920
raping is bad for your health

3428
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:53,200
yeah that's what it sounds like

3429
02:16:55,439 --> 02:16:58,240
never met a 100 zero waste and whole

3430
02:16:58,240 --> 02:17:00,558
food vegan so why expect non-vegans to

3431
02:17:00,558 --> 02:17:01,920
care

3432
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,280
exactly summer it's so obvious isn't it

3433
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,200
i always say health and environment are

3434
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:09,599
just consequences of animal abuse

3435
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:11,840
and our mentality towards animals and if

3436
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:12,799
we want to solve

3437
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:15,679
a problem we have to pull the root of

3438
02:17:15,679 --> 02:17:16,240
evil

3439
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:19,200
out very well said david if you said

3440
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:20,558
that to me when i wasn't vegan that

3441
02:17:20,558 --> 02:17:22,000
would punch me in the stomach in the

3442
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,920
best way

3443
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:26,638
you can see you can say would you like

3444
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:28,080
to know why we're here today yes thank

3445
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:30,478
you jaz you've been paying attention

3446
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:34,079
all right cool let's move on

3447
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:39,120
why don't people care about ethics let's

3448
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:40,478
explore that

3449
02:17:40,478 --> 02:17:42,558
because vegans don't advocate for

3450
02:17:42,558 --> 02:17:44,318
animals correctly

3451
02:17:44,318 --> 02:17:46,478
they focus on things like plant-based

3452
02:17:46,478 --> 02:17:47,519
recipes

3453
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:51,920
restaurants weight loss or deforestation

3454
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:54,240
another reason is they lead with phrases

3455
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:56,240
like friends not food

3456
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:59,599
or animal lovers don't eat animals

3457
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:01,519
this is not a conversation about

3458
02:18:01,519 --> 02:18:02,799
sympathy

3459
02:18:02,799 --> 02:18:04,240
this is a conversation about

3460
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:05,840
accountability

3461
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:08,638
don't plead with bystanders make them

3462
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:10,318
understand the consequences of their

3463
02:18:10,318 --> 02:18:12,558
choices by placing them in the victim's

3464
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:13,679
position

3465
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:17,200
30 seconds i don't have anything else to

3466
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:18,879
add to this

3467
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:25,839
unless you guys want me to expand on it

3468
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:38,160
um

3469
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:40,398
check out the majority of vegans online

3470
02:18:40,398 --> 02:18:43,840
rather not just on instagram vegan king

3471
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,679
they don't even talk about animals yeah

3472
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:47,280
it seems like in this movement that the

3473
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,920
animals barely get a mention

3474
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:52,638
they barely get a shout out and we

3475
02:18:52,638 --> 02:18:54,240
quickly move on to humans and

3476
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:55,920
humans humans humans how does this

3477
02:18:55,920 --> 02:19:00,080
affect humans let's talk about that

3478
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:04,160
when humans are the oppressors it's just

3479
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:07,840
backwards

3480
02:19:10,959 --> 02:19:12,000
all right cool you guys don't have

3481
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,240
anything uh you want me to expand on

3482
02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:15,760
here so i'm going to move on

3483
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:19,200
all right next slide morality is black

3484
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:20,879
and white when it comes to this

3485
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:22,799
issue specifically i'm talking about

3486
02:19:22,799 --> 02:19:25,040
guys okay i'm not talking about

3487
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,519
these fringe gray area examples that

3488
02:19:27,519 --> 02:19:28,638
could be brought up

3489
02:19:28,638 --> 02:19:31,760
with very insignificant choices you

3490
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:32,638
could say

3491
02:19:32,638 --> 02:19:34,879
this is very significant and it's

3492
02:19:34,879 --> 02:19:36,000
involving

3493
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,478
in it's involving oppression so when

3494
02:19:38,478 --> 02:19:39,599
you're talking about an issue of

3495
02:19:39,599 --> 02:19:41,120
oppression

3496
02:19:41,120 --> 02:19:44,398
where there are victims involved

3497
02:19:44,398 --> 02:19:46,080
morality is black and white when it

3498
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:47,679
comes to that if

3499
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:49,520
bystanders tell you that you aren't

3500
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:51,840
considering the other side to this

3501
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:54,560
or you aren't open-minded enough that is

3502
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:55,840
a distraction

3503
02:19:55,840 --> 02:19:58,479
there is no other side to needless

3504
02:19:58,479 --> 02:19:59,680
animal abuse

3505
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:02,319
you either support it or you don't don't

3506
02:20:02,319 --> 02:20:04,240
get lost in these distractions

3507
02:20:04,240 --> 02:20:06,800
compare animal abuse to a comparable

3508
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:08,800
injustice to get you back on track

3509
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,399
and like i was saying earlier on in this

3510
02:20:10,399 --> 02:20:13,040
video the best injustice to compare to

3511
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:15,200
is the one that involves the individual

3512
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:16,160
you're speaking

3513
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:19,200
to as the victim so if they

3514
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:21,840
imagine themselves as the victim of the

3515
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:23,439
injustice that you're speaking about

3516
02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:24,880
when you compare it

3517
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:26,800
that's going to be the best way for them

3518
02:20:26,800 --> 02:20:29,280
to feel what it is they need to feel in

3519
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:30,960
that moment

3520
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:45,840
30 seconds

3521
02:20:46,240 --> 02:20:47,600
good night daniel thank you for being a

3522
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:50,399
part of this man

3523
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:00,880
uh i don't know who epa is david

3524
02:21:05,439 --> 02:21:07,439
all right we've done 30 seconds i don't

3525
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:09,200
see anything you guys want me to

3526
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:13,840
expand on here so we're going to move on

3527
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:18,160
all right moving on so the next slide

3528
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:20,640
where we got to the 12th slide

3529
02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:24,840
okay which injustices to compare to

3530
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:27,120
so i actually break this

3531
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:29,120
last point i just made even further down

3532
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:31,120
in this slide it is most effective to

3533
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:33,040
compare to injustices such as

3534
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:35,920
child abuse or human trafficking child

3535
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:36,560
abuse

3536
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:38,000
and human trafficking are the most

3537
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
comparable human injustices that we've

3538
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:40,800
found

3539
02:21:40,800 --> 02:21:44,560
to compare to the most effective

3540
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:45,680
comparison to make

3541
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:47,920
is to place the bystander in the

3542
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:49,840
victim's position

3543
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:51,920
i just explained that but that's there

3544
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:53,439
for you again to

3545
02:21:53,439 --> 02:21:56,080
absorb i really want you to take that

3546
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:57,920
into consideration and really absorb

3547
02:21:57,920 --> 02:21:58,640
that

3548
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:00,880
avoid dog comparisons this goes back to

3549
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:03,520
not leading with compassion

3550
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,200
it's not about the love people feel

3551
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:07,120
towards animals it's about

3552
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:10,160
the hate they feel towards injustice

3553
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:13,439
and i would say injustice in their name

3554
02:22:13,439 --> 02:22:16,720
or because of them not in their name but

3555
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:19,680
because of their actions right in their

3556
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:21,600
name is kind of an ego thing

3557
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,520
it doesn't come down to whether you can

3558
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:25,359
imagine your dog in a slaughterhouse

3559
02:22:25,359 --> 02:22:27,280
it comes down to whether you can imagine

3560
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:29,359
yourself in a slaughterhouse

3561
02:22:29,359 --> 02:22:30,720
right i'm going to repeat that it

3562
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:32,000
doesn't come down to whether you can

3563
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,080
imagine your dog in a slaughterhouse

3564
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:35,920
it comes down to whether you can imagine

3565
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:38,319
yourself in a slaughterhouse

3566
02:22:38,319 --> 02:22:41,040
that's the truth that's what makes you

3567
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:42,720
really wake up to this

3568
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:51,840
30 seconds

3569
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:24,160
yeah so carlo about the moralities black

3570
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:25,680
and white you have to

3571
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:27,920
clarify that specifically we're talking

3572
02:23:27,920 --> 02:23:28,960
about

3573
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:32,479
injustices that involve victims

3574
02:23:32,479 --> 02:23:35,439
oppression these things are black and

3575
02:23:35,439 --> 02:23:36,080
white

3576
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:38,240
if it's needless and this is it needs to

3577
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:39,680
stop

3578
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:41,359
it's really simple you don't need to

3579
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:43,280
necessarily say morality is black and

3580
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:45,600
white

3581
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:47,439
i'm just pointing this out in this in

3582
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:49,920
this workshop for you guys

3583
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:51,680
that you need to understand morality is

3584
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:53,040
black and white and

3585
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:54,479
the way that you communicate this to

3586
02:23:54,479 --> 02:23:56,880
other people but you don't necessarily

3587
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:58,479
need to say morality is black and white

3588
02:23:58,479 --> 02:24:01,439
in those words

3589
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:02,960
but yeah if people want to get into a

3590
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:04,720
philosophical discussion you know just

3591
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:07,520
put an end to that

3592
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:10,640
america's environmental protection

3593
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:13,200
agency is the epa which is a broken

3594
02:24:13,200 --> 02:24:14,160
government system

3595
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:16,240
uh yeah i wouldn't i don't have any

3596
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:18,560
interest

3597
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:29,200
um okay

3598
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:30,479
yeah people just say they don't mind

3599
02:24:30,479 --> 02:24:32,479
eating dogs as well it

3600
02:24:32,479 --> 02:24:34,560
happens so often yeah what about dogs

3601
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,040
yeah well if i had to eat a dog i would

3602
02:24:37,040 --> 02:24:41,040
it just immediately blows up in our face

3603
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:42,640
um and i'm talking about most of the

3604
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:45,280
time here dog comparisons

3605
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:49,439
seemingly work niraj

3606
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:52,479
they seemingly work because your

3607
02:24:52,479 --> 02:24:55,439
indicator of an effective conversation

3608
02:24:55,439 --> 02:24:56,319
might be

3609
02:24:56,319 --> 02:24:59,760
someone doing this uh-huh yes

3610
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:02,560
i agree yes uh-huh that's not

3611
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:03,439
necessarily

3612
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:06,399
effective it's very easy to agree with

3613
02:25:06,399 --> 02:25:09,040
things like

3614
02:25:09,040 --> 02:25:11,520
um like if they had a dog with them and

3615
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:13,359
they obviously care about their dog

3616
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:15,040
like they're walking with the dog and

3617
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:16,640
then they're showing you know

3618
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:18,319
like empathy for their dog in some way

3619
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:19,600
and you say well what if that dog was

3620
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:20,800
stabbed to death

3621
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:22,840
yeah it's an easy thing to agree with

3622
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:24,560
yep

3623
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:26,560
but what happens when that dog dies in

3624
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:28,479
the family how long will they take to

3625
02:25:28,479 --> 02:25:30,240
grieve that dog's life

3626
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:33,920
compared to a human

3627
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:36,399
compared to how sad they would feel

3628
02:25:36,399 --> 02:25:38,479
about their own death and

3629
02:25:38,479 --> 02:25:40,720
if they were going to be murdered you

3630
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:43,439
see what i'm saying

3631
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:46,319
all right i'm going to move on i don't

3632
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:48,479
see any comments here

3633
02:25:48,479 --> 02:25:50,160
wanting me to expand on this particular

3634
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:52,000
slide i think i've covered as much as i

3635
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,040
can so let's move on

3636
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:58,399
statistics keep them minimal outside of

3637
02:25:58,399 --> 02:26:00,080
what is asked of you

3638
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:01,920
state minimal information during

3639
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:03,280
outreach conversations

3640
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:05,040
we are not on the streets to verbally

3641
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:07,040
leaflet again

3642
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:09,600
let the footage provide the context to

3643
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:10,880
the conversation

3644
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:12,720
you aren't at a cube of truth to be a

3645
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:14,080
statistician

3646
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:15,840
you're there to have a concise

3647
02:26:15,840 --> 02:26:17,840
conversation that holds people to

3648
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:18,560
account

3649
02:26:18,560 --> 02:26:21,840
for their unjustified animal abuse

3650
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:23,840
a conversation will go on for longer

3651
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:25,760
than necessary if it turns into an

3652
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:28,000
argument over statistic

3653
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,960
over statistics this is another reason

3654
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:32,640
why you should bring up health and

3655
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:34,319
environment talking points why you

3656
02:26:34,319 --> 02:26:35,359
shouldn't

3657
02:26:35,359 --> 02:26:38,720
pardon me this is another reason why you

3658
02:26:38,720 --> 02:26:39,680
shouldn't bring up

3659
02:26:39,680 --> 02:26:41,760
health and environment talking points

3660
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:44,000
because that usually leads into

3661
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:47,680
a never-ending debate about nothingness

3662
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,120
seconds if you guys have any points you

3663
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:50,720
want me to expand on

3664
02:26:50,720 --> 02:27:03,840
let me know

3665
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:06,880
yeah this is a good point here if the

3666
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:08,399
conversation went

3667
02:27:08,399 --> 02:27:11,520
to logic i usually believe the person

3668
02:27:11,520 --> 02:27:12,960
won't go vegan

3669
02:27:12,960 --> 02:27:16,080
try to keep it about the abuse and here

3670
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:16,800
it says

3671
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:18,399
best of a logic person is to go

3672
02:27:18,399 --> 02:27:22,080
plant-based veganisms from your heart

3673
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:25,359
you do need to hit people in the chest

3674
02:27:25,359 --> 02:27:27,120
people talk part of me you're talking

3675
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:28,560
about how

3676
02:27:28,560 --> 02:27:30,560
you know it's how you make people feel

3677
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:33,840
that's what people are going to remember

3678
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:36,640
moving on

3679
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:39,280
yeah it's not a debate club on the

3680
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:41,120
streets very good point street activism

3681
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:43,439
is not a debate club

3682
02:27:43,439 --> 02:27:46,800
moving on guys reachability and

3683
02:27:46,800 --> 02:27:49,520
conversation length not everybody on the

3684
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:51,760
streets is worth talking to part of your

3685
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:53,280
role is to assess

3686
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:55,920
who is reachable and who is not many

3687
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:57,760
people are not reachable

3688
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:59,040
if they want to have a short

3689
02:27:59,040 --> 02:28:01,280
conversation with you keep it short with

3690
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:02,080
them

3691
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:04,000
don't entertain bystanders who want to

3692
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:05,200
engage in long

3693
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:07,280
argumentative debates we just covered

3694
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:09,520
that do not underestimate the

3695
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:11,600
cunningness of non-vegan guilt

3696
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:15,120
and the ability that non vegans many

3697
02:28:15,120 --> 02:28:17,680
non-vegans will have to waste your vital

3698
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:19,920
time at work for the animals

3699
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:24,319
that's a huge point that last one 30

3700
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:27,840
seconds

3701
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:46,479
yeah part of the game here is assessing

3702
02:28:46,479 --> 02:28:48,960
who is reachable

3703
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:50,800
you get better at this with practice by

3704
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:55,840
the way

3705
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:06,880
yeah well jezebel you're right it's also

3706
02:29:06,880 --> 02:29:08,000
logical

3707
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,160
the point here is to not get lost in the

3708
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:11,040
logic

3709
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:13,840
you have to also have what hits people

3710
02:29:13,840 --> 02:29:16,640
in the chest too

3711
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:21,600
cunningness what is cunningness

3712
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:23,120
you mean the actual definition of the

3713
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:25,439
word

3714
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:28,800
let's look it up the actual definition

3715
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:30,880
of the word

3716
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:34,399
according to miriam webster is

3717
02:29:34,399 --> 02:29:37,120
skill in achieving one's ends through

3718
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:37,840
indirect

3719
02:29:37,840 --> 02:29:42,000
subtle or underhanded means

3720
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:44,240
and here's an example it took a certain

3721
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:45,520
amount of cunningness on the

3722
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:47,520
photographer's part to obtain such

3723
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:48,960
revealing portraits

3724
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:52,399
of his rich and famous subjects

3725
02:29:52,399 --> 02:29:55,040
anyhow the way it applies here in this

3726
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:55,760
context

3727
02:29:55,760 --> 02:29:58,960
is that non-vegans are very

3728
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:00,720
cunning in the way that they address

3729
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:02,560
these arguments with vegans and the way

3730
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:03,520
that they

3731
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,600
try to make vegans think that plants

3732
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:07,680
have feelings for example like they

3733
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:10,080
really get deep into it and they're like

3734
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:12,319
yeah like they feel stuff and like yeah

3735
02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:13,840
they're like they act like they really

3736
02:30:13,840 --> 02:30:15,600
believe it

3737
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:18,880
but it's just

3738
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:22,640
their cunningness is a lie

3739
02:30:22,640 --> 02:30:26,319
it's really their guilt trying to double

3740
02:30:26,319 --> 02:30:26,960
down

3741
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:29,760
you know so um are there any questions

3742
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:31,040
here i'm not even going to do the 30

3743
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:32,319
seconds thing because i've given you

3744
02:30:32,319 --> 02:30:34,399
guys plenty of time while i've been

3745
02:30:34,399 --> 02:30:36,880
talking

3746
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:43,920
yes it does stay online afterwards malia

3747
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:45,920
this will be available online once i'm

3748
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:48,160
done

3749
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:54,160
you can tell by their body language when

3750
02:30:54,160 --> 02:30:55,760
they're not even looking at the footage

3751
02:30:55,760 --> 02:30:57,040
because they're

3752
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,560
only there to waste our time yeah

3753
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:01,840
if they don't want to be there just get

3754
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:05,600
them to go just go

3755
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:08,880
indirect distractions and so on yes

3756
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:10,640
exactly

3757
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:15,840
indirect distractions that's what it is

3758
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:25,680
all right moving on guys it doesn't seem

3759
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:27,200
like you guys want me to expand on much

3760
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:28,960
here so i might even just keep this

3761
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:29,680
moving

3762
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:33,200
at a quicker pace activism is not sales

3763
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:34,880
sales training does not equal good

3764
02:31:34,880 --> 02:31:38,080
activism using slick talk

3765
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:40,479
to trick people into veganism doesn't

3766
02:31:40,479 --> 02:31:41,200
work

3767
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:43,120
your job is to hold the bystander

3768
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:44,479
accountable it's

3769
02:31:44,479 --> 02:31:47,600
up to them which actions they take

3770
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:50,399
initially av made too strong of a

3771
02:31:50,399 --> 02:31:53,280
connection between sales and activism

3772
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:56,080
tools taught in sales training only go

3773
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:58,080
so far

3774
02:31:58,080 --> 02:31:59,840
any questions about this or anything you

3775
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:01,920
want me to expand on it

3776
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:04,880
30 seconds but

3777
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:07,920
[ __ ] i might even reduce this down even

3778
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,840
further

3779
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:12,479
10 seconds

3780
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:16,880
now i'll keep it at 30 seconds but uh

3781
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:20,640
let me let me know guys if you want me

3782
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:25,359
to break anything down further for you

3783
02:32:25,359 --> 02:32:28,000
five seconds

3784
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:35,200
moving on so the next slide

3785
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:37,200
activism is not sales we're still

3786
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:40,399
continuing on this thing

3787
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:42,640
a successful conversation is not one

3788
02:32:42,640 --> 02:32:44,800
where the bystander says i'm going vegan

3789
02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:46,960
that's not necessarily the thing that

3790
02:32:46,960 --> 02:32:48,560
you should be looking for

3791
02:32:48,560 --> 02:32:51,840
it's where you say the right things most

3792
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:53,760
people become vegan after they hear the

3793
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,960
truth from us

3794
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:56,560
how long it takes is up to the

3795
02:32:56,560 --> 02:32:59,200
individual

3796
02:32:59,439 --> 02:33:02,160
30 seconds

3797
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:08,960
okay so uh there's a question here

3798
02:33:08,960 --> 02:33:10,479
i'm you're still confused about the

3799
02:33:10,479 --> 02:33:12,160
sales thing could you give me an example

3800
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:14,000
or more could you be more specific about

3801
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:21,840
what you're confused about

3802
02:33:24,399 --> 02:33:26,000
good question summer do you still

3803
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,160
promote feel felt found i never really

3804
02:33:28,160 --> 02:33:29,920
understood what that means

3805
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:32,560
again that was just a communication tool

3806
02:33:32,560 --> 02:33:34,960
i thought it would be helpful

3807
02:33:34,960 --> 02:33:38,319
i don't use it anymore and it's not in

3808
02:33:38,319 --> 02:33:39,120
this outreach

3809
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:41,760
workshop for a reason that you have

3810
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:43,840
pointed out and i appreciate that

3811
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:46,000
we've removed it because again we make

3812
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:47,439
too strong of a connection

3813
02:33:47,439 --> 02:33:48,960
to sales and i don't want people to

3814
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:51,680
think that these communication tools

3815
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:55,040
are the approach like this is that's not

3816
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:57,280
an approach

3817
02:33:57,280 --> 02:33:59,280
that's just a tool a little tiny little

3818
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:00,720
tool that can help

3819
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:02,960
with your communication but feel fat

3820
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:04,160
found

3821
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:06,640
no you don't really need to use that and

3822
02:34:06,640 --> 02:34:08,319
we've removed it

3823
02:34:08,319 --> 02:34:11,280
it's unnecessary

3824
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:17,120
what you said about giving fair warning

3825
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:19,040
before asking a question or commenting

3826
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:21,680
is a good way to proceed

3827
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:25,040
awesome like how do we know

3828
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:26,880
if we've made an impact on their

3829
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:30,000
perception apart from their guilt

3830
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:34,080
you don't uh you well you don't

3831
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:36,319
there are certain indicators but like we

3832
02:34:36,319 --> 02:34:38,560
say here most people become vegan after

3833
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:40,399
they hear the truth from us

3834
02:34:40,399 --> 02:34:42,160
how long it takes is up to the

3835
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:44,080
individual and that's why i say i want

3836
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:45,439
you to connect

3837
02:34:45,439 --> 02:34:49,520
to this

3838
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:52,720
approach in in i want you to connect to

3839
02:34:52,720 --> 02:34:53,840
understanding that

3840
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:55,600
if you say the right things on behalf of

3841
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:57,280
the victims then you have succeeded in

3842
02:34:57,280 --> 02:34:58,240
your outreach

3843
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:01,120
because that's the best you can do the

3844
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:02,960
next step is physically forcing people

3845
02:35:02,960 --> 02:35:05,760
to become vegan which we can't do

3846
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:13,840
does that help

3847
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:18,479
sales is too much practical

3848
02:35:18,479 --> 02:35:21,920
veganism is more from the from our

3849
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:22,800
internals

3850
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:25,520
not sure what you mean there soilless

3851
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:27,840
magician

3852
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:29,840
is it good to start with the socratic

3853
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:31,439
method to get to know where the

3854
02:35:31,439 --> 02:35:32,479
individual is

3855
02:35:32,479 --> 02:35:34,080
at well socratic questioning is

3856
02:35:34,080 --> 02:35:35,920
something that we touch on in this

3857
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:39,359
so jazz just stick around and i'll get

3858
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:40,479
into that

3859
02:35:40,479 --> 02:35:44,080
further all right guys i'm gonna move on

3860
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:48,080
okay that does help good let's move on

3861
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,479
the socratic the very next slide there

3862
02:35:54,479 --> 02:35:57,120
it is jazz

3863
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:02,080
maybe we sensed the line of questions

3864
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:03,520
that might come from you guys and that's

3865
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:04,880
why we put this slide next all right so

3866
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:06,479
socratic the socratic method

3867
02:36:06,479 --> 02:36:08,479
socratic questioning is a communication

3868
02:36:08,479 --> 02:36:11,200
tool that we use within our approach

3869
02:36:11,200 --> 02:36:15,359
it is not an approach in and of itself

3870
02:36:15,359 --> 02:36:18,319
and neither is the sales thing where we

3871
02:36:18,319 --> 02:36:19,600
ask questions

3872
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:21,760
to lead the bystander to their own

3873
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:23,200
conclusions so yes

3874
02:36:23,200 --> 02:36:25,600
jazz you're right and i'll read that

3875
02:36:25,600 --> 02:36:26,640
again okay

3876
02:36:26,640 --> 02:36:28,399
so credit questioning is a communication

3877
02:36:28,399 --> 02:36:30,399
tool that we use within our approach it

3878
02:36:30,399 --> 02:36:32,479
is not an approach in and of itself

3879
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:34,800
where we ask questions to lead the

3880
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:38,479
bystander to their own conclusions

3881
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:41,600
use open-ended questions such as

3882
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:44,800
why are you sorry let me start again use

3883
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:46,080
open-ended questions such as

3884
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:48,640
why are you against animal abuse instead

3885
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:50,800
of a closed statement such as animal

3886
02:36:50,800 --> 02:36:52,800
abuse is wrong

3887
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:55,040
open-ended questions are generally

3888
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:57,760
prefer preferred

3889
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:00,080
i've got a problem with speaking today

3890
02:37:00,080 --> 02:37:01,680
open-ended questions are generally

3891
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:02,720
preferred

3892
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:04,960
to anchor and progress the conversation

3893
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:06,960
you should use closed-ended questions

3894
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:09,200
and statements

3895
02:37:09,200 --> 02:37:19,760
30 seconds

3896
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:21,439
would it be possible to ask the

3897
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:22,880
non-vegan to give us

3898
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:24,880
feedback on the conversation they had

3899
02:37:24,880 --> 02:37:27,120
well

3900
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:28,960
we kind of do at the end we say what do

3901
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:30,960
you think you'll do that

3902
02:37:30,960 --> 02:37:33,840
gives you the answer

3903
02:37:42,160 --> 02:37:44,479
and danya if i'm saying you're not your

3904
02:37:44,479 --> 02:37:46,560
name correctly

3905
02:37:46,560 --> 02:37:48,160
dania could you also point out the tip

3906
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:50,399
about

3907
02:37:50,479 --> 02:37:52,319
open-ended questions are generally

3908
02:37:52,319 --> 02:37:53,760
preferred

3909
02:37:53,760 --> 02:37:55,600
to anchor and progress the conversation

3910
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:56,880
you should you should use

3911
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:58,560
closed-ended questions and statements so

3912
02:37:58,560 --> 02:38:00,000
we're not saying use open-ended

3913
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,240
questions all the time that's just

3914
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:04,880
ridiculous

3915
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:08,800
but generally they are preferred i'm

3916
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:11,359
going to move on now

3917
02:38:11,359 --> 02:38:14,479
to the next slide

3918
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:18,720
you versus we we don't torture animals

3919
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:19,359
and kill

3920
02:38:19,359 --> 02:38:22,720
animals for products non-vegans do using

3921
02:38:22,720 --> 02:38:23,200
we

3922
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:25,920
undermines individual accountability

3923
02:38:25,920 --> 02:38:27,840
when you tell non-vegans that we as a

3924
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:29,680
society are responsible for animal

3925
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:31,760
cruelty in farms it takes away the

3926
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:33,280
imperative for the individual

3927
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:35,120
accountability

3928
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:37,840
it makes them think of lobbying

3929
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:39,520
government programs

3930
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:43,760
etc instead of personal responsibilities

3931
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:45,920
people need to feel guilty to change

3932
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:47,840
they'll only change once they understand

3933
02:38:47,840 --> 02:38:49,920
that there is a difference between you

3934
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:52,960
the vegan and them the non-vegan and

3935
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:54,960
that difference needs to be very

3936
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:57,840
clear

3937
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:11,840
30 seconds

3938
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,840
i can add and say that guilt is the only

3939
02:39:25,840 --> 02:39:26,720
way

3940
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:28,720
in my opinion to get people to go vegan

3941
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:31,120
not plant-based but transform them into

3942
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:33,359
a vegan activist that's gonna change the

3943
02:39:33,359 --> 02:39:36,080
[ __ ] world

3944
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:39,840
amen

3945
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:49,600
um can we mean i was in the same boat as

3946
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:52,160
the non-vegan well that's the thing it's

3947
02:39:52,160 --> 02:39:53,760
being used that way

3948
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:56,880
but when you say we you no longer do it

3949
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:59,600
so it's just completely inaccurate

3950
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:01,920
you're making an inaccurate statement in

3951
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:05,040
an effort to seem more humble

3952
02:40:05,040 --> 02:40:08,240
which is really just trying to be liked

3953
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:10,000
which is really focusing on getting

3954
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:11,760
compassion from the abusers

3955
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:13,680
as opposed to focusing your compassion

3956
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:16,399
on the victims

3957
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:21,840
does that help

3958
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:36,560
all right moving on thank you for your

3959
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:39,040
comments guys but um

3960
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:42,479
i'm going to move on so on to the next

3961
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:44,479
people already know how to go vegan this

3962
02:40:44,479 --> 02:40:46,399
is the why versus how

3963
02:40:46,399 --> 02:40:48,000
people already know how to go vegan with

3964
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,319
the constant availability of

3965
02:40:50,319 --> 02:40:52,479
google and the internet people are

3966
02:40:52,479 --> 02:40:54,560
literally glued to their phones

3967
02:40:54,560 --> 02:40:57,359
in 2020. anybody can figure out how to

3968
02:40:57,359 --> 02:40:58,960
become vegan instantly

3969
02:40:58,960 --> 02:41:00,960
in order for people to feel the need to

3970
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:02,000
become vegan

3971
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:03,920
they need to be held accountable for why

3972
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:07,520
they said for why they should do it

3973
02:41:07,520 --> 02:41:10,479
my vision is going blurry at this point

3974
02:41:10,479 --> 02:41:11,520
i'll read that again

3975
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:13,600
in order for people to feel the need to

3976
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:15,279
become vegan they need to be held

3977
02:41:15,279 --> 02:41:16,000
accountable for

3978
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:19,120
why they should do it with any other

3979
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:21,200
injustice you would never focus on

3980
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:25,040
the how by talking about how

3981
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:28,240
to not participate in the violence

3982
02:41:28,240 --> 02:41:30,960
so i'm reading this incorrectly let me

3983
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:31,600
start again

3984
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:33,200
with any other injustice you would never

3985
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:35,920
focus on the how by talking about how

3986
02:41:35,920 --> 02:41:38,399
to not participate in the violence

3987
02:41:38,399 --> 02:41:40,240
focusing on the how in the context of

3988
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:41,600
any other injustice

3989
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:44,000
would be an insult to the victims and

3990
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
the entire movement fighting to end

3991
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:59,840
their oppression 30 seconds

3992
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:04,000
how do you convince intersectionals to

3993
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,359
be vegan

3994
02:42:05,359 --> 02:42:08,560
intersectionals to be vegan i'm assuming

3995
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:09,680
they're not vegan then

3996
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:14,319
usually i find intersectionals are vegan

3997
02:42:14,319 --> 02:42:16,080
but if they're if they're not even vegan

3998
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:17,600
you i would just say

3999
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:21,439
to talk to them like you talk to anybody

4000
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:27,840
else

4001
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:48,160
yes moving on guys thank you on to the

4002
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:50,399
next slide

4003
02:42:50,399 --> 02:42:52,880
vegetarianism is cancer to animal rights

4004
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:55,439
vegetarians are non-vegans and should be

4005
02:42:55,439 --> 02:42:57,359
outreached in the same manner as anyone

4006
02:42:57,359 --> 02:42:58,160
else

4007
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:01,040
and in most cases even harder because

4008
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:03,439
vegetarians act so pompous

4009
02:43:03,439 --> 02:43:06,560
vegetarians are our target market

4010
02:43:06,560 --> 02:43:08,960
they're no different to paleo eaters why

4011
02:43:08,960 --> 02:43:12,640
should we treat them any differently

4012
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:16,160
they are not allies don't let other

4013
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:18,560
non-vegans

4014
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:21,120
and vegans manipulate you into thinking

4015
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,000
that they are

4016
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:25,680
30 seconds i don't have anything to add

4017
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:26,319
to these

4018
02:43:26,319 --> 02:43:28,960
points if

4019
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:34,080
if i'm just moving straight into

4020
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:36,160
looking at the comments and it doesn't

4021
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:38,960
look like you guys

4022
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:41,200
want me to expand on this it's pretty

4023
02:43:41,200 --> 02:43:44,000
straightforward

4024
02:43:46,640 --> 02:43:50,399
all right five seconds

4025
02:43:50,399 --> 02:43:53,439
vegetarians are proper carnists yeah

4026
02:43:53,439 --> 02:43:55,760
well said

4027
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:58,000
they should get tenfold harsher activism

4028
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
especially if they're pompous

4029
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,800
especially if they're pompous all right

4030
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:04,720
moving on

4031
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:07,279
typical outreach structure ask them if

4032
02:44:07,279 --> 02:44:09,279
they would like to know why you're here

4033
02:44:09,279 --> 02:44:11,840
this was asked earlier

4034
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:13,760
ask them if they would like to know why

4035
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:15,840
you're here and with the context of the

4036
02:44:15,840 --> 02:44:17,279
footage playing

4037
02:44:17,279 --> 02:44:18,880
tell them what the cube of truth sets

4038
02:44:18,880 --> 02:44:20,560
out to do

4039
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:22,319
what we are doing is showing the reality

4040
02:44:22,319 --> 02:44:24,160
of what happens to animals and the meat

4041
02:44:24,160 --> 02:44:26,880
dairy egg and other industries

4042
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:28,800
everything you see here is standard

4043
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:30,240
practice here

4044
02:44:30,240 --> 02:44:32,880
and around the world asking the

4045
02:44:32,880 --> 02:44:35,120
following open-ended question

4046
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:37,760
what are your feelings on animal abuse

4047
02:44:37,760 --> 02:44:39,680
then confirm their stance

4048
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:42,560
to form moral consistency with something

4049
02:44:42,560 --> 02:44:44,240
like so it's safe to say that you are

4050
02:44:44,240 --> 02:44:46,640
against animal abuse

4051
02:44:46,640 --> 02:45:01,840
30 seconds

4052
02:45:12,840 --> 02:45:15,840
hmm

4053
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:20,319
moving on

4054
02:45:22,399 --> 02:45:24,960
we're nearly nearly finished with these

4055
02:45:24,960 --> 02:45:26,319
slides also guys

4056
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:28,800
typical outreach structure ask them do

4057
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:30,800
they think it's possible to be against

4058
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:32,720
animal abuse while demanding products

4059
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:36,160
like meat dairy and eggs

4060
02:45:36,240 --> 02:45:39,680
i don't think we covered this in the uh

4061
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:42,880
presentation but this is a powerful

4062
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:44,720
point i'm going to read it again

4063
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:46,720
ask them do you think it's possible to

4064
02:45:46,720 --> 02:45:48,800
be against animal abuse while demanding

4065
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:52,240
products like meat dairy and eggs

4066
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:55,279
ask them what is stopping them from not

4067
02:45:55,279 --> 02:45:58,160
abusing animals and being vegan

4068
02:45:58,160 --> 02:46:00,560
what do you feel like would be stopping

4069
02:46:00,560 --> 02:46:02,560
you from not abusing animals

4070
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:04,960
and being vegan this will lead to their

4071
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:06,399
objections

4072
02:46:06,399 --> 02:46:11,840
30 seconds

4073
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:17,840
how to respond if they don't consider

4074
02:46:17,840 --> 02:46:20,319
those footage

4075
02:46:20,319 --> 02:46:23,120
wow let me read this question out um how

4076
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:24,000
to respond if

4077
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,760
people don't consider the footage to be

4078
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:27,200
animal abuse

4079
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:29,520
you have no conversation to be having

4080
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:31,040
with that person move on to the next

4081
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:32,720
person

4082
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:36,240
if blood flying everywhere and heads

4083
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:36,880
being

4084
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:41,439
cut off is not animal abuse

4085
02:46:41,439 --> 02:46:45,920
if baby male chicks if baby chicks

4086
02:46:45,920 --> 02:46:49,279
are being grinded alive

4087
02:46:49,279 --> 02:46:51,600
in a big blender and they don't think

4088
02:46:51,600 --> 02:46:54,800
that's animal abuse

4089
02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:59,040
you're not talking to a rational person

4090
02:46:59,040 --> 02:47:01,120
so i would say you need to move on to

4091
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:04,319
the next person jezebel

4092
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:06,560
if they say they don't care about animal

4093
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:08,720
abuse is it best just to end the

4094
02:47:08,720 --> 02:47:10,319
conversation

4095
02:47:10,319 --> 02:47:12,880
i would say what if you were the one

4096
02:47:12,880 --> 02:47:15,840
being abused

4097
02:47:15,840 --> 02:47:18,960
would you care then or it's easy to say

4098
02:47:18,960 --> 02:47:21,200
when you're the abuser

4099
02:47:21,200 --> 02:47:23,600
what if you were the one being abused

4100
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:26,960
that's the upgrade there for you

4101
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:31,600
and then move on if it goes downhill

4102
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:32,800
from there because

4103
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:35,600
this is not a rational open and willing

4104
02:47:35,600 --> 02:47:38,640
person you're speaking to

4105
02:47:42,880 --> 02:47:46,240
carlo recently you said in a video

4106
02:47:46,240 --> 02:47:48,399
we have to avoid the word vegan i'm a

4107
02:47:48,399 --> 02:47:50,000
little confused about it now

4108
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,080
so you suggest to openly say we are

4109
02:47:52,080 --> 02:47:54,399
promoting veganism or not

4110
02:47:54,399 --> 02:47:56,319
i never said to not use the word vegan

4111
02:47:56,319 --> 02:47:58,160
in fact i say i said that i used the

4112
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:00,160
word vegan

4113
02:48:00,160 --> 02:48:02,720
it's just what i'm saying carlo is that

4114
02:48:02,720 --> 02:48:03,279
it's

4115
02:48:03,279 --> 02:48:06,560
far more effective for us to explain

4116
02:48:06,560 --> 02:48:08,960
what the meaning like to say human

4117
02:48:08,960 --> 02:48:11,439
supremacy or animal abuse

4118
02:48:11,439 --> 02:48:14,319
you know to detail what it really means

4119
02:48:14,319 --> 02:48:15,279
to be vegan

4120
02:48:15,279 --> 02:48:19,200
like if in this point

4121
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:21,920
um if i mean at this point in the

4122
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:23,600
conversation you're saying if we are

4123
02:48:23,600 --> 02:48:28,399
saying that we're promoting veganism um

4124
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:30,319
this is it depends this is something

4125
02:48:30,319 --> 02:48:32,240
that i would say if someone says

4126
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:34,880
you're promoting vegetarianism i would

4127
02:48:34,880 --> 02:48:36,720
correct that and say we're not promoting

4128
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,080
vegetarianism because that doesn't

4129
02:48:38,080 --> 02:48:39,680
address the issue at all

4130
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:43,359
we're promoting veganism so i would

4131
02:48:43,359 --> 02:48:45,760
not shy away from saying the word vegan

4132
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:47,279
however it's usually

4133
02:48:47,279 --> 02:48:49,520
best for you to talk about what that

4134
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:51,279
word actually means than to just use the

4135
02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:52,399
word

4136
02:48:52,399 --> 02:48:55,920
why because the word has a lot of

4137
02:48:55,920 --> 02:48:57,520
confusion around it within the animal

4138
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:58,880
rights movement

4139
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:00,640
you can see how there's so many

4140
02:49:00,640 --> 02:49:02,560
definitions flying around

4141
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:04,399
and that's why we started this with the

4142
02:49:04,399 --> 02:49:07,920
definition of veganism itself

4143
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:11,760
even if they are killed quickly it is

4144
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:13,439
still animal abuse of course because

4145
02:49:13,439 --> 02:49:14,640
again

4146
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:17,760
if you were the victim it is still abuse

4147
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:19,439
to take your life even if it's done

4148
02:49:19,439 --> 02:49:21,040
quickly of course you would see it as

4149
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:21,680
abuse

4150
02:49:21,680 --> 02:49:25,200
in that circumstance

4151
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:27,040
you know the jews who were killed in the

4152
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:28,880
concentration camps if they were gassed

4153
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:29,840
and killed quickly

4154
02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:31,520
that doesn't make the injustice any less

4155
02:49:31,520 --> 02:49:33,840
worse

4156
02:49:38,800 --> 02:49:42,960
cool um moving on

4157
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:45,600
next slide objection handling whenever a

4158
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:47,279
bystander brings up an objection

4159
02:49:47,279 --> 02:49:49,200
place them in the victim's position and

4160
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:51,200
allow them to analyze the objection

4161
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:54,000
from that perspective every single time

4162
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,080
this happens the objection will fall

4163
02:49:56,080 --> 02:49:57,520
apart

4164
02:49:57,520 --> 02:49:59,439
most objections are easy and quick to

4165
02:49:59,439 --> 02:50:00,720
respond to

4166
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:03,040
some are more nuanced and require a

4167
02:50:03,040 --> 02:50:04,720
deeper explanation

4168
02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:06,240
but they should still be quick to

4169
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:09,120
respond to your response should always

4170
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:12,080
anchor back to individual accountability

4171
02:50:12,080 --> 02:50:12,640
this

4172
02:50:12,640 --> 02:50:16,319
can't be more simple this is so simple

4173
02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:23,840
again 30 seconds

4174
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:51,840
all right moving on

4175
02:50:52,240 --> 02:50:54,240
bring it back to the individual if they

4176
02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:56,960
try to create excuses that try to remove

4177
02:50:56,960 --> 02:50:59,359
accountability for example pointing to

4178
02:50:59,359 --> 02:51:01,439
rural communities

4179
02:51:01,439 --> 02:51:04,960
lions low income families etc

4180
02:51:04,960 --> 02:51:08,000
don't get lost in lengthy explanations

4181
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,319
bring it back to the individual by

4182
02:51:10,319 --> 02:51:12,000
placing themselves in the victims

4183
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:12,880
position

4184
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:15,279
and asking how that excuse justifies

4185
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:17,359
their personal contribution

4186
02:51:17,359 --> 02:51:20,479
to animal abuse

4187
02:51:21,680 --> 02:51:23,120
i don't know if contribution is the

4188
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:25,279
right word i might update that but you

4189
02:51:25,279 --> 02:51:28,640
guys know what this is saying

4190
02:51:31,359 --> 02:51:35,680
uh yeah 30 seconds i'm gonna

4191
02:51:35,680 --> 02:51:39,680
shave five seconds off that so 25

4192
02:51:44,840 --> 02:51:47,840
seconds

4193
02:51:52,319 --> 02:51:56,240
objections are good they can be good yes

4194
02:51:56,240 --> 02:52:01,840
they can be good

4195
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:08,640
all right moving on next slide

4196
02:52:11,439 --> 02:52:15,359
um tying the benefit tying the benefit

4197
02:52:15,359 --> 02:52:17,680
only once they concede by saying if

4198
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:19,600
they're against animal abuse then it's

4199
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:21,840
not possible to be against animal abuse

4200
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:23,439
while supporting it

4201
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:25,680
the number one benefit of going vegan

4202
02:52:25,680 --> 02:52:27,120
for the animals

4203
02:52:27,120 --> 02:52:29,200
the benefit is that they no longer have

4204
02:52:29,200 --> 02:52:32,479
to be tortured and abused because of you

4205
02:52:32,479 --> 02:52:35,279
for you if you say you are against

4206
02:52:35,279 --> 02:52:36,479
animal abuse

4207
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:38,720
and what you see on the screens then

4208
02:52:38,720 --> 02:52:39,680
when you're vegan

4209
02:52:39,680 --> 02:52:43,200
you no longer have to be a hypocrite

4210
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:44,960
and so we're going to update this part

4211
02:52:44,960 --> 02:52:46,479
like i said

4212
02:52:46,479 --> 02:52:48,960
to say when you're vegan you have the

4213
02:52:48,960 --> 02:52:50,720
opportunity

4214
02:52:50,720 --> 02:52:53,760
for the first time in your life to not

4215
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:57,359
be a hypocrite

4216
02:52:57,359 --> 02:53:00,240
so that's the update there when you're

4217
02:53:00,240 --> 02:53:01,120
vegan

4218
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:02,640
you now have the opportunity to no

4219
02:53:02,640 --> 02:53:04,160
longer be a hypocrite

4220
02:53:04,160 --> 02:53:06,080
this drives home the accountability and

4221
02:53:06,080 --> 02:53:08,080
makes them understand the consequence of

4222
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:09,279
their actions

4223
02:53:09,279 --> 02:53:11,840
30 seconds

4224
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:30,160
wow this has gone on for ages i saw it

4225
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:32,479
like five hours ago govi

4226
02:53:32,479 --> 02:53:33,760
well jen you know i'm trying to make

4227
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:36,080
sure that this workshop is

4228
02:53:36,080 --> 02:53:40,080
as thorough as possible but we're almost

4229
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:42,880
about to wrap up

4230
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:49,200
do people only care about being

4231
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:51,439
hypocrites yeah because it affects

4232
02:53:51,439 --> 02:53:53,279
people care about themselves and the

4233
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:56,560
image of themselves and

4234
02:53:56,560 --> 02:53:58,560
if you want to hit people and and mess

4235
02:53:58,560 --> 02:54:00,479
up their ego about themselves that's how

4236
02:54:00,479 --> 02:54:02,080
you do it you you call them out on

4237
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:03,279
things like this and this is

4238
02:54:03,279 --> 02:54:05,359
unfortunately how people

4239
02:54:05,359 --> 02:54:07,760
work i mean i wish that it was just as

4240
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:08,800
easy as saying

4241
02:54:08,800 --> 02:54:11,439
guys we have 50 less than 50 years left

4242
02:54:11,439 --> 02:54:12,240
on this planet

4243
02:54:12,240 --> 02:54:13,920
animal abuse is the biggest pressing

4244
02:54:13,920 --> 02:54:15,439
issue of our time we have

4245
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:17,520
no right to be abusing animals please

4246
02:54:17,520 --> 02:54:19,120
stop

4247
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:22,720
if that was it was just as easy as that

4248
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:24,560
i would i would that's what i would be

4249
02:54:24,560 --> 02:54:25,840
telling you to do in this outreach

4250
02:54:25,840 --> 02:54:28,560
workshop but it's not

4251
02:54:28,560 --> 02:54:31,120
moving on

4252
02:54:31,680 --> 02:54:34,640
26 all right close the conversation

4253
02:54:34,640 --> 02:54:36,720
always end outreach conversations

4254
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:38,880
by asking what the individual will

4255
02:54:38,880 --> 02:54:40,240
personally do

4256
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:44,479
to take action ask them open and ask

4257
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:47,120
the open-ended question after our

4258
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:48,319
conversation

4259
02:54:48,319 --> 02:54:49,760
what are you going to do about this

4260
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:52,000
injustice

4261
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,640
after a long conversation they may still

4262
02:54:54,640 --> 02:54:55,680
say that they'll

4263
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:58,880
only reduce or do nothing

4264
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:01,040
if they can if you can sense that the

4265
02:55:01,040 --> 02:55:02,000
interaction will

4266
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:03,520
keep going in circles end the

4267
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:05,680
conversation with the statement

4268
02:55:05,680 --> 02:55:17,840
30 seconds

4269
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:30,560
from a outsider point of view this vegan

4270
02:55:30,560 --> 02:55:33,439
approach is genius

4271
02:55:33,439 --> 02:55:36,720
david velas is in the comments

4272
02:55:36,720 --> 02:55:40,160
and seems effective and david is not

4273
02:55:40,160 --> 02:55:42,080
vegan

4274
02:55:42,080 --> 02:55:44,720
joining us and giving his feedback on

4275
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:45,760
this approach

4276
02:55:45,760 --> 02:55:47,680
i appreciate it david i appreciate your

4277
02:55:47,680 --> 02:55:49,200
feedback

4278
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:52,240
but you know that this is going to be

4279
02:55:52,240 --> 02:55:54,160
a huge thing for you that you have to

4280
02:55:54,160 --> 02:55:57,200
face because this whole conversation

4281
02:55:57,200 --> 02:55:59,359
if you're telling us it's effective what

4282
02:55:59,359 --> 02:56:01,120
we really want to know is how effective

4283
02:56:01,120 --> 02:56:01,520
is it

4284
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:03,920
for you

4285
02:56:06,640 --> 02:56:10,000
all right let's move on

4286
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:15,520
so this is the last slide guys

4287
02:56:15,840 --> 02:56:17,520
closing the conversation an effective

4288
02:56:17,520 --> 02:56:19,600
statement in this situation can be so

4289
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:21,520
keep in mind that for however long that

4290
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:22,560
you're not vegan

4291
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:24,479
animals will be abused and tortured

4292
02:56:24,479 --> 02:56:25,680
because of you

4293
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,760
so when you're ready to stop abusing

4294
02:56:27,760 --> 02:56:29,760
animals and align your actions with your

4295
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:30,640
words

4296
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:32,880
you know what to do so think about what

4297
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:33,920
side of history

4298
02:56:33,920 --> 02:56:37,359
you want to stand on and that closed

4299
02:56:37,359 --> 02:56:40,720
um that closes the conversation but this

4300
02:56:40,720 --> 02:56:41,600
is also

4301
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:44,880
the question that we have for you david

4302
02:56:44,880 --> 02:56:47,680
this question is for you what are you

4303
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:55,840
going to do

4304
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:08,000
your question david i'm not sure on

4305
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,640
uh how would i respond to someone saying

4306
02:57:10,640 --> 02:57:14,240
that they would hire animals

4307
02:57:14,560 --> 02:57:16,640
it's i don't i've never heard that

4308
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:18,880
before but hiring i'm not sure if you've

4309
02:57:18,880 --> 02:57:20,319
used the wrong word there but hiring

4310
02:57:20,319 --> 02:57:22,319
animals is still exploitation

4311
02:57:22,319 --> 02:57:24,240
that's just another word for enslaving

4312
02:57:24,240 --> 02:57:26,720
animals

4313
02:57:26,800 --> 02:57:28,479
but i'm not quite sure i understand your

4314
02:57:28,479 --> 02:57:31,040
question there

4315
02:57:31,520 --> 02:57:35,279
